The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has brought about significant improvements in natural language processing tasks. However, deploying these models on edge devices remains a challenge due to their substantial computational and memory requirements. Addressing this issue, Microsoft Research introduced Bitnet.cpp, an open-source inference framework designed to facilitate efficient and lossless inference of ternary LLMs, particularly BitNet b1.58, on CPU architectures.

BitNet b1.58 employs a ternary quantization scheme, where each weight is constrained to one of three values: -1, 0, or +1. This design choice effectively encodes each weight using approximately 1.58 bits of information, hence the model’s name. By adopting this approach, BitNet b1.58 significantly reduces the model’s memory footprint and computational complexity, enabling faster inference and lower energy consumption. Despite this extreme quantization, the model maintains performance comparable to full-precision counterparts across various benchmarks.

To support efficient inference of such low-bit models, Bitnet.cpp introduces a novel mixed-precision General Matrix Multiplication (mpGEMM) library. This library incorporates two core solutions: the Ternary Lookup Table (TL) and Int2 with a Scale (I2\_S). The TL addresses spatial inefficiencies of previous bit-wise methods by enabling rapid matrix multiplications through precomputed lookup tables. Meanwhile, the I2\_S ensures lossless edge inference by maintaining the integrity of computations despite the reduced bit-width.

Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Bitnet.cpp achieves significant performance gains. On x86 CPUs, it delivers speedups ranging from 2.37x to 6.17x compared to full-precision baselines, with energy reductions between 71.9% and 82.2%. Similarly, on ARM CPUs, speedups range from 1.37x to 5.07x, accompanied by energy savings of 55.4% to 70.0% . Notably, Bitnet.cpp can run a 100B BitNet b1.58 model on a single CPU, achieving speeds comparable to human reading (5-7 tokens per second), significantly enhancing the potential for running LLMs on local devices.

The open-source nature of Bitnet.cpp, available at Microsoft’s GitHub repository, encourages collaboration and further development within the AI community. By providing a practical solution for deploying large-scale LLMs on edge devices, Bitnet.cpp paves the way for more accessible and energy-efficient AI applications. As the demand for on-device intelligence grows, frameworks like Bitnet.cpp will play a crucial role in bringing powerful AI capabilities to a broader range of platforms.
