What is the Creative Ops Copilot Skill?
---------------------------------------

The Creative Ops Copilot is an advanced skill designed to transform messy client briefs into production-ready plans for motion design and VFX projects. This powerful tool takes raw input from emails, notes, or chat logs and converts them into structured, client-ready documentation that includes scope definitions, assumptions, deliverables matrices, schedules, and accurate cost estimates.

Core Functionality
------------------

The skill operates by first requesting or inferring the input brief. Users can either paste text directly or provide a file path to a brief or email thread export. Once the brief is processed, the Creative Ops Copilot generates several essential outputs:

### Primary Outputs

* **docs/creative-ops/plan.md** – A client-ready project plan
* **docs/creative-ops/estimate.json** – Structured line items with pricing
* **docs/creative-ops/invoice-draft.json** – Ready for API import into invoicing systems

### Optional Features

The skill can also create a complete project folder skeleton with AE/C4D/Octane-friendly structure, generate README documentation, and even post invoice drafts to local invoicing APIs when configured. This comprehensive approach ensures that every aspect of project setup is handled efficiently.

Canonical Output Structure
--------------------------

The plan.md output follows a specific structure designed for maximum clarity and client communication. It begins with a concise project summary, followed by clearly defined goals and success criteria. The deliverables section presents a comprehensive matrix detailing formats, durations, aspect ratios, versions, and audio requirements.

### Workflow Documentation

The skill meticulously documents workflow assumptions, explicitly stating what’s included and excluded from the project scope. It also specifies the number of review rounds and identifies open questions that need client clarification. This transparency helps prevent scope creep and ensures all parties have aligned expectations.

### Production Planning

The production plan section outlines phases, milestones, and review windows in a logical sequence. Risk assessment and dependency identification help teams prepare for potential challenges. The estimate section provides detailed line items with hours, rates, subtotals, and contingency calculations, giving clients a clear understanding of the investment required.

Reliable Generation Process
---------------------------

The Creative Ops Copilot follows a structured approach to ensure consistent, reliable outputs. It begins by extracting key entities from the brief, including client names, project titles, deadlines, deliverables, and constraints. The skill then determines the appropriate production approach, whether template-driven or bespoke, and selects between 2D After Effects, 3D Cinema 4D, or mixed workflows.

### Realistic Estimation

Motion design and VFX projects require realistic time estimation. The skill accounts for pre-production activities like briefing and style frames, production phases including animation and 3D work, audio and music considerations, rendering and versioning, project management buffer, and any necessary scripts or plugins. This comprehensive approach ensures estimates reflect actual project requirements.

Recommended Scripts and Usage
-----------------------------

The skill includes bundled Python scripts that create consistent outputs. Users can run the main script with various parameters: –brief for direct text input, –brief-file for file paths, –out for output directory specification, –skeleton for project folder creation, and –push-invoice for API integration. These scripts streamline the workflow and ensure standardized outputs across projects.

### Command Line Examples

Basic usage involves running the script with the brief text and output directory. For file-based briefs, the –brief-file parameter specifies the path. The –skeleton parameter creates a complete project structure, while –push-invoice attempts to send the invoice draft to a configured local API. These flexible options accommodate various workflow preferences and technical environments.

Configuration Options
---------------------

The skill supports optional configuration through a JSON file that can be copied from the example and customized. Key configuration options include the invoicing API base URL and API key, as well as rate card defaults. This configuration allows for seamless integration with existing systems and ensures pricing consistency across projects.

Best Practices and Notes
------------------------

The Creative Ops Copilot emphasizes concise, clean, and client-ready outputs. When information is missing or ambiguous in the brief, the skill surfaces these as open questions rather than making assumptions. This approach maintains professional integrity and prevents misunderstandings that could derail projects later.

### Professional Implementation

The skill is designed for professional creative operations teams who need to convert client communications into actionable project plans quickly and accurately. By automating the documentation and estimation process, it frees creative professionals to focus on the actual creative work while ensuring all administrative and planning aspects are handled systematically.

Conclusion
----------

The Creative Ops Copilot represents a significant advancement in creative project management, combining the analytical rigor of project management with the creative understanding required for motion design and VFX work. By providing structured, professional outputs from unstructured client briefs, it bridges the gap between creative vision and practical execution, ultimately leading to more successful projects and satisfied clients.
