<h1>Network Discovery Stuck Off in Windows 11/10? Here&#8217;s How to Fix It Permanently</h1>
<p>Are you frustrated with network discovery refusing to turn on in Windows 11 or Windows 10? This common networking issue can prevent you from seeing other devices on your local network, making file sharing and printer access a nightmare. When network discovery is disabled, your PC becomes invisible to other devices on the network, and you can&#8217;t see them either.</p>
<p>In this comprehensive guide, we&#8217;ll walk you through the various causes of network discovery being stuck off and provide multiple working solutions to restore proper network visibility. Whether you&#8217;re a home user trying to share files between devices or an IT professional managing network resources, these methods will help you get your Windows 11/10 network discovery working again.</p>
<h2>Understanding Network Discovery in Windows</h2>
<p>Network discovery is a fundamental feature in Windows that allows your computer to detect other devices and resources on the same network. When enabled, Windows actively searches for computers, printers, and other devices sharing the same local network connection.</p>
<p>This feature is closely related to file and printer sharing, which must also be enabled for network discovery to function properly. Together, these features create the foundation for seamless local network communication in Windows environments.</p>
<p>When network discovery is working correctly, you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>See other computers and devices in File Explorer under the Network section</li>
<li>Access shared folders and printers on other network devices</li>
<li>Make your own computer visible to others on the network</li>
<li>Stream media to other devices like smart TVs or game consoles</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why Network Discovery Might Be Stuck Off</h2>
<p>Network discovery can become disabled for several reasons, ranging from system updates to misconfigured settings. Understanding these potential causes can help you prevent future issues and diagnose problems more effectively.</p>
<h3>Common Causes of Network Discovery Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Windows Updates:</strong> Recent updates might reset network-related settings to default values.</li>
<li><strong>Group Policy Changes:</strong> If you&#8217;re using Windows Pro or Enterprise editions, Group Policy settings might override your preferences.</li>
<li><strong>Antivirus Software:</strong> Security programs sometimes block network features for protection.</li>
