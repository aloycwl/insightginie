<p>In the world of digital information, &#8220;now&#8221; is easy. Securing a credit card transaction that takes milliseconds to process requires speed, not longevity. However, for governments, legal firms, and enterprise archivists, the challenge is entirely different. They are responsible for land deeds, mortgages, birth certificates, and nuclear waste disposal records—documents that must remain verifiable not just for seconds, but for decades or even centuries.</p>

<p>This poses a terrifying cryptographic problem. The algorithms we use today to sign these documents (RSA and ECDSA) are destined to break. A sufficiently powerful quantum computer, likely to emerge within the next few decades, will be able to forge these signatures effortlessly. A land deed signed today could be mathematically challenged in 2040, rendering the chain of custody void.</p>

<p>Enter&nbsp;<strong>SLH-DSA</strong>&nbsp;(Stateless Hash-Based Digital Signature Algorithm). Recently standardized by NIST as&nbsp;<strong>FIPS 205</strong>, this algorithm is not designed for the speed of the web. It is designed for the permanence of history. It represents the &#8220;digital concrete&#8221; of the post-quantum era, offering a conservative, resilient solution for long-term digital archiving.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Problem: &#8220;Sign Now, Forge Later&#8221;</h2>

<p>We often hear about the &#8220;Harvest Now, Decrypt Later&#8221; threat regarding encryption. For digital signatures, the threat is&nbsp;<strong>&#8220;Sign Now, Forge Later.&#8221;</strong></p>

<p>If an organization digitally signs a PDF using RSA-2048 today, that signature is mathematically binding. However, once quantum computers become viable, an attacker could retrospectively generate a new, malicious private key that corresponds to the old public key (or find a collision). They could then modify the archived document—changing the owner of a property or the terms of a treaty—and re-sign it so it looks perfectly valid according to the original verification rules.</p>

<p>For archives with retention schedules exceeding 15 years, reliance on legacy cryptography is a ticking time bomb. The only solution is to apply a signature scheme today that we are confident will withstand the mathematics of the 22nd century.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why SLH-DSA is the Archivist’s Choice</h2>

<p>NIST has released multiple Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) standards, primarily&nbsp;<strong>ML-DSA</strong>&nbsp;(Lattice-based) and&nbsp;<strong>SLH-DSA</strong>&nbsp;(Hash-based). While ML-DSA is faster and better suited for the internet, SLH-DSA is the superior choice for archiving.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. The Conservative Bet</h3>

<p>Cryptographers are paranoid by nature. While Lattice-based cryptography (ML-DSA) is believed to be secure, it relies on relatively complex mathematical structures that have only been intensely scrutinized for about two decades.</p>

<p>SLH-DSA, however, relies solely on the security of&nbsp;<strong>Hash Functions</strong>&nbsp;(like SHA-256). We have been attacking and analyzing hash functions since the 1990s. The assumption is simple: as long as SHA-256 remains collision-resistant, SLH-DSA remains secure. There is no &#8220;hidden math&#8221; that might suddenly crumble. For a document that needs to survive for 50 years, this conservative approach is the ultimate insurance policy.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Statelessness for Reliability</h3>

<p>Early iterations of hash-based signatures were &#8220;stateful,&#8221; meaning the signer had to track how many times a key was used. If that state was lost (e.g., a server backup restore), the security collapsed.</p>

<p>SLH-DSA is&nbsp;<strong>stateless</strong>. It generates signatures deterministically and safely without requiring complex state management. This is crucial for archival systems where keys might be stored in cold storage (HSMs) and accessed only rarely over many years. It eliminates the risk of &#8220;operational error&#8221; destroying the archive&#8217;s integrity.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Trade-Off: Storage is Cheap, Trust is Expensive</h2>

<p>The main criticism of SLH-DSA is the size of its signatures. A typical SLH-DSA signature is roughly&nbsp;<strong>41KB</strong>&nbsp;(at security level 5). Compared to an RSA signature (0.2KB), this is massive.</p>

<p>In a high-frequency trading environment, a 41KB payload is a disaster. In digital archiving, it is a rounding error.</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Context:</strong> A high-resolution scanned PDF of a contract might be 5MB. Adding a 41KB signature increases the file size by less than 1%.</li>

<li><strong>Cost:</strong> With modern cloud storage costs, the price of storing those extra kilobytes over 50 years is negligible compared to the legal cost of a forged signature.</li>
</ul>

<p>For archiving, bandwidth is irrelevant. We are not optimizing for transmission speed; we are optimizing for irrefutable proof.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Implementing PAdES and Long-Term Validation (LTV)</h2>

<p>To operationalize SLH-DSA in archiving, it must be integrated into existing standards, specifically&nbsp;<strong>PAdES</strong>&nbsp;(PDF Advanced Electronic Signatures) and&nbsp;<strong>LTV</strong>&nbsp;(Long-Term Validation).</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Role of Timestamping</h3>

<p>A digital signature proves&nbsp;<em>who</em>&nbsp;signed a document, but not&nbsp;<em>when</em>. If a key is compromised in 2040, how do we know the document was signed legitimately in 2024?</p>

<p>The solution is a&nbsp;<strong>Trusted Timestamp</strong>.</p>

<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>The Signature:</strong> The document is signed using SLH-DSA (FIPS 205).</li>

<li><strong>The Timestamp:</strong> A hash of that signature is sent to a Time Stamping Authority (TSA), which signs it with its own time-locked key.</li>

<li><strong>The LTV Blob:</strong> The PDF file embeds the document, the SLH-DSA signature, the Timestamp, and the full Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) valid at the time of signing.</li>
</ol>

<p>By embedding SLH-DSA into the PAdES-LTV profile, the document becomes a self-contained artifact of truth. Even if the Certificate Authority goes out of business 30 years from now, the embedded validation data—secured by the quantum-resistant SLH-DSA signature—ensures the document remains verifiable.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Migration Strategies for Enterprise Archives</h2>

<p>Organizations managing long-term records need a migration plan. Waiting for quantum computers to arrive is too late.</p>

<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Hybrid Signing:</strong> During the transition period, use &#8220;Composite Signatures.&#8221; Sign the document with both RSA-4096 (for current compatibility with legacy PDF readers) and SLH-DSA (for future proofing).</li>

<li><strong>Re-Signing (RFC 3126):</strong> For existing archives, implement a re-signing process. This involves taking legacy RSA-signed documents and wrapping them in a new archival timestamp signature using SLH-DSA. This &#8220;seals&#8221; the old signature with quantum-resistant crypto without altering the original document.</li>

<li><strong>Hardware Upgrade:</strong> Ensure that Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) used for the root archival keys are upgraded to support FIPS 205 key generation.</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In the ephemeral world of the internet, data is often treated as disposable. But in the legal and historical world, data is permanent. The validity of a will, a patent, or a treaty cannot hold an expiration date based on the limitations of 20th-century mathematics.</p>

<p>SLH-DSA provides the bridge to the future. By accepting the trade-off of larger file sizes, archivists gain the mathematical certainty of hash-based security. It is the most robust, conservative, and defensible choice for any organization that owes a fiduciary duty to the future. Implementing FIPS 205 today is not just an IT upgrade; it is an act of historical preservation.</p>
