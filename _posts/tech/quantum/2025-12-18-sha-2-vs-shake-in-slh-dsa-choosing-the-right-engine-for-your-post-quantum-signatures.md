<p>When the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) finalized&nbsp;<strong>FIPS 205</strong>, establishing&nbsp;<strong>SLH-DSA</strong>&nbsp;as the standard for stateless hash-based digital signatures, they did not provide a single, monolithic algorithm. Instead, they provided a framework with choices.</p>

<p>Beyond the decisions regarding signature size (Small vs. Fast) and security levels (128, 192, 256), there is a fundamental architectural decision every implementer must make:&nbsp;<strong>The Hash Function.</strong></p>

<p>FIPS 205 explicitly defines two distinct &#8220;flavors&#8221; of SLH-DSA based on the core cryptographic engine used:</p>

<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>SLH-DSA-SHA2</strong> (relying on the SHA-2 family)</li>

<li><strong>SLH-DSA-SHAKE</strong> (relying on the SHA-3/Keccak family)</li>
</ol>

<p>For SLH-DSA, the hash function is not just a utility; it is the entire security model. Unlike RSA or Elliptic Curve cryptography, which rely on number theory, SLH-DSA is built entirely out of hashes. Therefore, the choice between SHA-2 and SHAKE influences performance, hardware compatibility, and implementation complexity.</p>

<p>This article dissects the roles of these two hash families within SLH-DSA to help you select the right engine for your post-quantum infrastructure.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The &#8220;Security-Only&#8221; Assumption</h2>

<p>To understand why this choice matters, we must reiterate the unique nature of SLH-DSA. In this algorithm, the security of the digital signature is directly reducible to the security of the underlying hash function.</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>If the hash function is collision-resistant and preimage-resistant, the signature is secure.</li>

<li>If the hash function breaks, the signature scheme breaks instantly.</li>
</ul>

<p>NIST included both SHA-2 and SHAKE to provide&nbsp;<strong>diversity</strong>. If a cryptanalytic breakthrough were to weaken one family (e.g., a new attack on the Merkle-Damgård structure of SHA-2), the industry could pivot to the other (the Sponge construction of SHAKE) without abandoning the SLH-DSA standard entirely.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Contender 1: The SHA-2 Family (SHA-256 / SHA-512)</h2>

<p><strong>SHA-2</strong>&nbsp;(Secure Hash Algorithm 2) is the veteran of the industry. Designed by the NSA and published in 2001, it is ubiquitous. From TLS certificates to Bitcoin, SHA-2 is the backbone of the current digital economy.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Architecture: Merkle-Damgård</h3>

<p>SHA-2 utilizes the&nbsp;<strong>Merkle-Damgård</strong>&nbsp;construction. It processes data in fixed-size blocks (512 bits for SHA-256, 1024 bits for SHA-512).</p>

<p>In the context of SLH-DSA, this presents a slight engineering challenge. SLH-DSA requires the ability to process inputs of varying lengths and produce outputs of varying lengths to construct the Hypertree and WOTS+ chains. Because SHA-2 outputs a fixed length (e.g., 32 bytes), implementing it inside SLH-DSA requires additional mechanisms—specifically&nbsp;<strong>HMAC</strong>&nbsp;(Hash-based Message Authentication Code) or&nbsp;<strong>MGF1</strong>&nbsp;(Mask Generation Functions)—to extend the output or randomize the input safely.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Hardware Advantage</h3>

<p>The primary argument for choosing&nbsp;<strong>SLH-DSA-SHA2</strong>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<strong>Hardware Acceleration</strong>.</p>

<p>Almost all modern processors—from Intel and AMD CPUs in servers to ARM chips in mobile phones—have dedicated instruction sets for SHA-2 (specifically SHA-256).</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Performance:</strong> On hardware with SHA extensions, SLH-DSA-SHA2 can be incredibly fast. The CPU can process the hashing operations natively, drastically reducing the cycle count for signing and verification.</li>

<li><strong>Legacy Support:</strong> Because SHA-2 has been the standard for two decades, virtually every crypto library, hardware security module (HSM), and smart card supports it out of the box.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Contender 2: The SHAKE Family (SHAKE-128 / SHAKE-256)</h2>

<p><strong>SHAKE</strong>&nbsp;represents the modern era. It is based on&nbsp;<strong>Keccak</strong>, the winner of the NIST SHA-3 competition. While it is newer, it offers a level of flexibility that older algorithms cannot match.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Architecture: The Sponge Construction</h3>

<p>SHAKE uses a&nbsp;<strong>Sponge construction</strong>. It &#8220;absorbs&#8221; data into its state and then &#8220;squeezes&#8221; it out. Unlike SHA-2, SHAKE is an&nbsp;<strong>XOF (Extendable Output Function)</strong>.</p>

<p>This is a game-changer for SLH-DSA. An XOF allows the developer to request an output of&nbsp;<em>any</em>&nbsp;length.</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Need a 32-byte hash for a node? SHAKE can do it.</li>

<li>Need a 100-byte bitmask? SHAKE can do it without needing complex loops or counter modes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of this, the internal implementation of&nbsp;<strong>SLH-DSA-SHAKE</strong>&nbsp;is cleaner and simpler. It does not require the HMAC wrappers needed for SHA-2. It simply absorbs the input and squeezes the exact number of bytes required for the signature components.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Software Performance</h3>

<p>In pure software implementations (where no dedicated hardware acceleration is available), SHAKE/Keccak is often faster than SHA-2. Its internal permutations are designed to be efficient in software. For generic microcontrollers or older systems lacking SHA extensions, SLH-DSA-SHAKE often wins the race.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Parameter Sets</h2>

<p>FIPS 205 defines the parameter sets by combining the hash function with the security category.</p>

<p><strong>For SHA-2:</strong></p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>SLH-DSA-SHA2-128s/f:</strong> Uses SHA-256.</li>

<li><strong>SLH-DSA-SHA2-192s/f:</strong> Uses SHA-512 (truncated).</li>

<li><strong>SLH-DSA-SHA2-256s/f:</strong> Uses SHA-512.</li>

<li><em>Note: The switch to SHA-512 at higher levels provides a significant speed boost on 64-bit platforms.</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>For SHAKE:</strong></p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>SLH-DSA-SHAKE-128s/f:</strong> Uses SHAKE-128.</li>

<li><strong>SLH-DSA-SHAKE-192s/f:</strong> Uses SHAKE-256.</li>

<li><strong>SLH-DSA-SHAKE-256s/f:</strong> Uses SHAKE-256.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Choosing the Right Engine: A Decision Matrix</h2>

<p>Which one should you implement? The answer depends on your deployment environment.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Choose SLH-DSA-SHA2 if:</h3>

<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>You rely on Hardware Acceleration:</strong> Your servers run modern Intel/AMD/ARM chips with SHA extensions. The performance gain here is undeniable.</li>

<li><strong>You require FIPS 140-2/3 validated modules <em>now</em>:</strong> Most existing certified HSMs already have optimized SHA-2 engines.</li>

<li><strong>You prefer the &#8220;Tried and True&#8221;:</strong> SHA-2 has a longer history of widespread deployment than Keccak.</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Choose SLH-DSA-SHAKE if:</h3>

<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>You are running on non-accelerated hardware:</strong> If you are deploying to RISC-V chips or older embedded systems without SHA instructions, SHAKE often performs better in software.</li>

<li><strong>You value code simplicity:</strong> The implementation of SHAKE within the SLH-DSA logic is more elegant and less prone to implementation errors regarding padding and masking.</li>

<li><strong>You want Masking Protection:</strong> The sponge construction of Keccak makes it slightly easier to implement side-channel protections (like masking against power analysis) compared to the HMAC-SHA2 constructions.</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Both SHA-2 and SHAKE provide the robust security foundation required for FIPS 205. The &#8220;security&#8221; difference between them is negligible for practical purposes—both are considered secure against quantum and classical attacks.</p>

<p>The choice, therefore, is one of&nbsp;<strong>optimization</strong>.</p>

<p>If you are building high-throughput server farms to verify signatures,&nbsp;<strong>SLH-DSA-SHA2</strong>&nbsp;is likely your champion due to the ubiquity of hardware instructions. If you are building a clean, modern codebase for diverse IoT devices or prioritizing side-channel resistance,&nbsp;<strong>SLH-DSA-SHAKE</strong>&nbsp;offers the modern flexibility you need.</p>

<p>Ultimately, NIST’s decision to include both ensures that SLH-DSA remains resilient. Whether powered by the veteran Merkle-Damgård or the agile Sponge, the engine of hash-based signatures is ready for the post-quantum road ahead.</p>
