<p>As developers and security architects begin incorporating the new&nbsp;<strong>FIPS 205</strong>&nbsp;standard into their cryptographic libraries, they are encountering a subtle but critical distinction in the Application Programming Interface (API). Unlike older RSA implementations where &#8220;signing&#8221; was often a monolithic concept, SLH-DSA (Stateless Hash-Based Digital Signature Algorithm) explicitly defines two distinct modes of operation:&nbsp;<strong>Pure Signing</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Pre-Hash Signing</strong>.</p>

<p>In the API documentation, these often appear as functions like&nbsp;slh_sign&nbsp;(or simply&nbsp;sign) and&nbsp;slh_sign_prehash.</p>

<p>While it is tempting to treat these as interchangeable utility functions, choosing the wrong one can have significant implications for system performance, hardware compatibility, and the cryptographic security properties of your application. This article dissects the mechanics of these two modes, explains why NIST distinguished them, and guides you on which one to use for your specific use case.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Paradigm Shift: Why Two Modes?</h2>

<p>To understand the difference, we must look at the &#8220;Hash-and-Sign&#8221; paradigm.</p>

<p>In traditional digital signatures (like RSA or ECDSA), the algorithm can only technically sign a small number of bits (e.g., 256 bits). Therefore, you never sign the message (</p>

<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>M<em>M</em></code></pre>

<p>) directly; you essentially always sign the hash of the message (</p>

<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>H(M)<em>H</em>(<em>M</em>)</code></pre>

<p>). Historically, APIs obscured this, handling the hashing internally or expecting the developer to hash the data before calling the function.</p>

<p>FIPS 205 formalizes this distinction to address modern security concerns regarding collision resistance and protocol substitution attacks. It mandates that the verifier must know&nbsp;<em>exactly</em>&nbsp;which method was used, as the mathematical construction of the signature changes based on the mode.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Mode 1: Pure Signing (slh_sign)</h2>

<p><strong>Pure Signing</strong>&nbsp;is the default, preferred, and theoretically more robust method for SLH-DSA.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How It Works</h3>

<p>When you call&nbsp;slh_sign(private_key, message, context), you pass the&nbsp;<em>entire</em>&nbsp;raw message into the function. The algorithm itself is responsible for processing the message digest.</p>

<p>Crucially, in SLH-DSA, Pure Signing introduces a&nbsp;<strong>Randomizer (</strong></p>

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"><strong><code>R<em>R</em></code></strong></pre>

<p><strong>)</strong>. The algorithm generates a random value and includes it in the internal hashing of the message. The signature is effectively generated over a randomized digest of the message.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Security Advantage</h3>

<p>Because the algorithm ingests the full message and applies its own randomized hashing logic, Pure Signing is resilient against certain types of collision attacks. Even if an attacker can find a collision in the underlying hash function, they cannot easily exploit it because they cannot control the randomizer (</p>

<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>R<em>R</em></code></pre>

<p>) that the signer will select at the moment of signing.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Limitation</h3>

<p>The limitation of Pure Signing is&nbsp;<strong>bandwidth and memory</strong>. To use it, the signing device must have access to the full message.</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>If you are signing a 100GB disk image, you must stream all 100GB into the signing function.</li>

<li>If the signing key lives inside a Hardware Security Module (HSM) connected via USB or a slow network link, transferring the full 100GB to the HSM is operationally impossible.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Mode 2: Pre-Hash Signing (slh_sign_prehash)</h2>

<p><strong>Pre-Hash Signing</strong>&nbsp;is the pragmatic alternative designed for constrained environments and large datasets.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How It Works</h3>

<p>In this mode, the application (the &#8220;caller&#8221;) hashes the message first using a standard hash function (like SHA-256 or SHAKE-256) to produce a digest (</p>

<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>PH(M)<em>P</em><em>H</em>(<em>M</em>)</code></pre>

<p>). This small digest is then passed to the signing function:&nbsp;slh_sign_prehash(private_key, digest, context, OID).</p>

<p>The SLH-DSA algorithm then signs this digest. However, to prevent ambiguity, FIPS 205 requires that the signature inputs include an&nbsp;<strong>Object Identifier (OID)</strong>&nbsp;identifying the hash function used to create the digest.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Use Case: HSMs and Large Files</h3>

<p>Pre-Hash signing is essential for:</p>

<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>HSMs and Smart Cards:</strong> You hash the 100GB file on the host server, producing a 32-byte hash. You send only those 32 bytes to the HSM. The HSM signs the hash and returns the signature. This saves massive amounts of bandwidth.</li>

<li><strong>Legacy Protocols:</strong> Protocols that are hardcoded to &#8220;hash then sign&#8221; may effectively force this workflow.</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Security Trade-Off</h3>

<p>The security of Pre-Hash signing depends strictly on the collision resistance of the pre-hash function selected by the user. Because the hashing happens&nbsp;<em>outside</em>&nbsp;the randomized envelope of the SLH-DSA logic, if an attacker can find a collision in your pre-hash function (e.g., finding two files that hash to the same SHA-256 value), they can forge a signature.</p>

<p>While SHA-256 and SHAKE are currently secure, Pure Signing offers a higher theoretical buffer against future cryptanalytic breakthroughs in hash functions.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Domain Separation: The Critical Role of Contexts</h2>

<p>A major innovation in FIPS 205, applicable to both modes, is the&nbsp;<strong>Context String</strong>.</p>

<p>In both&nbsp;slh_sign&nbsp;and&nbsp;slh_sign_prehash, the API accepts an optional&nbsp;context&nbsp;argument (up to 255 bytes). This provides&nbsp;<strong>Domain Separation</strong>.</p>

<p>Imagine you use the same private key to sign firmware updates and financial transactions. An attacker might trick you into signing a piece of data that looks like a firmware update but is actually a valid financial transaction structure.</p>

<p>By mandating a context string (e.g., &#8220;FIRMWARE_v1&#8221; vs. &#8220;TRANSACTION_v1&#8221;), the internal hashes are mathematically completely different. A signature generated with the context &#8220;FIRMWARE&#8221; will fail verification if the verifier expects &#8220;TRANSACTION,&#8221; even if the message/digest is identical.</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Note:</strong> In Pre-Hash mode, the OID of the hash function effectively acts as an additional layer of domain separation, ensuring a signature created for a SHA-256 digest cannot be verified as a SHA-512 digest.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Decision Matrix: Which API Should You Use?</h2>

<p>When implementing SLH-DSA in your software, use the following logic to choose the correct API:</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Can you hold the message in memory?</h3>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Yes (e.g., API tokens, small documents):</strong> Use <strong>Pure Signing (slh_sign)</strong>. It is simpler and provides the maximum security benefit of the algorithm&#8217;s internal randomization.</li>

<li><strong>No (e.g., ISO files, video logs):</strong> Use <strong>Pre-Hash Signing (slh_sign_prehash)</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Where does the private key live?</h3>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Local Memory:</strong> Use <strong>Pure Signing</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Remote HSM / Cloud KMS:</strong> Use <strong>Pre-Hash Signing</strong>. The latency of sending the full payload to the external signer is usually unacceptable.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. What does your protocol require?</h3>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>TLS/X.509:</strong> Modern TLS stacks (TLS 1.3) generally prefer or mandate Pure Signing where possible to maximize security guarantees.</li>

<li><strong>Legacy Codebases:</strong> If you are retrofitting a system that is architected strictly around &#8220;Hash externally -> Sign hash,&#8221; you may be forced to use Pre-Hash mode to minimize refactoring.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The distinction between&nbsp;slh_sign&nbsp;and&nbsp;slh_sign_prehash&nbsp;is not merely syntactic sugar; it is a fundamental architectural decision in FIPS 205.</p>

<p><strong>Pure Signing</strong>&nbsp;is the secure default, leveraging the full power of SLH-DSA to randomize signatures and protect against collision attacks.&nbsp;<strong>Pre-Hash Signing</strong>&nbsp;is the necessary bridge to the real world of hardware constraints and massive datasets.</p>

<p>As a developer, your goal should be to use Pure Signing whenever the physical constraints of your infrastructure allow it, reserving Pre-Hash signing for scenarios where bandwidth or hardware isolation makes the Pure approach impossible. By understanding these modes, you ensure your PQC migration is not just compliant, but architecturally sound.</p>
