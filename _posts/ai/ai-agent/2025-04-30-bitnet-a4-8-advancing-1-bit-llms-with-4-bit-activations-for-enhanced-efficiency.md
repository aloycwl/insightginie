<p>As the demand for deploying large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained environments grows, the focus has shifted towards optimizing both model weights and activations for efficiency. Building upon the foundation laid by BitNet b1.58, which introduced 1.58-bit quantized weights using ternary values (-1, 0, +1), researchers have now turned their attention to activation quantization. This progression has led to the development of BitNet a4.8, a model that employs 4-bit activations in conjunction with 1.58-bit weights, aiming to enhance inference efficiency without compromising performance.​</p>

<p>BitNet a4.8 introduces a hybrid quantization and sparsification strategy to address the challenges posed by activation outliers—rare but significant activation values that can adversely affect model performance when quantized. Specifically, the model applies 4-bit quantization to the inputs of attention and feed-forward network (FFN) layers, where activations typically follow a Gaussian-like distribution. For intermediate states, which are more prone to outlier activations, BitNet a4.8 employs sparsification followed by 8-bit quantization. This approach effectively balances the need for low-bit precision with the preservation of critical activation information.</p>

<p>One of the notable features of BitNet a4.8 is its ability to activate only 55% of the model&#8217;s parameters during inference. This selective activation contributes to reduced computational load and energy consumption, making the model more suitable for deployment on devices with limited resources. Additionally, BitNet a4.8 supports a 3-bit key-value (KV) cache, further optimizing memory usage and inference speed.</p>

<p>Training BitNet a4.8 involves a two-stage process. Initially, the model is trained with 8-bit activations (denoted as W1.58A8) to establish a robust foundation. Subsequently, it undergoes continued pretraining to adapt to 4-bit activations (W1.58A4). This methodology leverages the observation that while the optimal configurations for low-bit weights differ significantly from their higher-precision counterparts, the optimal configurations for low-bit activations are relatively close to those of higher-precision activations.</p>

<p>The implementation of BitNet a4.8 is facilitated by an unofficial PyTorch repository, which provides the necessary components such as RMSNorm for layer normalization, 4-bit and 8-bit quantizers, TopK sparsification, and the BitLinear module for 1.58-bit weights. This implementation enables researchers and developers to experiment with and deploy BitNet a4.8 in various applications .​<br>GitHub</p>

<p>In summary, BitNet a4.8 represents a significant advancement in the pursuit of efficient and scalable LLMs. By integrating 4-bit activations with 1.58-bit weights and employing a hybrid quantization-sparsification strategy, the model achieves a balance between performance and resource efficiency. This development holds promise for the broader adoption of LLMs in environments where computational resources are at a premium.​</p>
