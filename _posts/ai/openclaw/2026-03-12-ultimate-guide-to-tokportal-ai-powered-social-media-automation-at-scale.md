</ol>
<h2>Practical Applications and Workflows</h2>
<p>The TokPortal skill unlocks powerful automation capabilities for social media management. Let&#8217;s explore some practical use cases and workflows:</p>
<h3>1. Creating TikTok Accounts with Video Content</h3>
<p>To create a TikTok account with five videos, you would instruct your OpenClaw agent with a command like: &#8220;Create a TikTok bundle in the US with 5 videos and niche warming for fitness content.&#8221;</p>
<p>The agent would then:</p>
<ol>
<li>Call the <code>create_bundle</code> tool with appropriate parameters</li>
<li>Guide you through the account configuration process</li>
<li>Help set up and configure each of the five video posts</li>
</ol>
<h3>2. Account Analytics Monitoring</h3>
<p>To check analytics for all your delivered accounts, use: &#8220;Show me the analytics for all my delivered accounts.&#8221; The agent would:</p>
<ol>
<li>Call <code>list_accounts</code> to retrieve all account information</li>
<li>For each account, call <code>get_analytics</code> to gather performance data</li>
<li>Compile and present the analytics in a comprehensive format</li>
</ol>
<h3>3. Bulk Video Distribution</h3>
<p>For large-scale operations, you might use: &#8220;Create 10 TikTok accounts in France with 3 videos each.&#8221; This would employ the Performance Max feature via <code>create_bulk_bundles</code>, allowing the agent to create all 10 bundles with a single API call.</p>
