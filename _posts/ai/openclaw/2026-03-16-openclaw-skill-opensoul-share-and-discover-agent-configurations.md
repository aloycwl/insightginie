<h2>What OpenSoul Does</h2>
<p>OpenSoul is an OpenClaw skill designed to help users share their agent workspace configurations with the broader OpenClaw community while maintaining privacy. It extracts your setup, anonymizes sensitive information, and uploads it to opensoul.cloud where others can browse, search, and get inspired by different agent configurations.</p>
<h2>Core Functionality</h2>
<p>The skill provides a complete workflow for sharing your OpenClaw workspace. It extracts key files like SOUL.md (your agent&#8217;s persona), AGENTS.md (workflow patterns), and TOOLS.md (tool configurations), then automatically anonymizes personal information including names, email addresses, API keys, and project details. The skill also generates intelligent summaries of your setup using either pattern matching or a local LLM for more contextual insights.</p>
<h2>Key Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Workspace sharing with automatic PII anonymization</li>
<li>Community browsing to discover how others use OpenClaw</li>
<li>Personalized suggestions based on your current setup</li>
<li>Import capabilities to download inspiring configurations</li>
<li>Local LLM integration for better summary generation</li>
<li>Preview mode to review what will be shared before uploading</li>
<li>Personal notes to add context to your shared configurations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To use OpenSoul, you&#8217;ll need Node.js and optionally tsx installed. The basic workflow involves registering yourself once with opensoul register, then using opensoul share to upload your workspace. You can browse the community with opensoul browse, get suggestions with opensoul suggest, or import configurations with opensoul import.</p>
<h2>Privacy Protection</h2>
<p>OpenSoul takes privacy seriously by automatically replacing personal information with placeholders like [USER], [PROJECT_N], [EMAIL], and [API_KEY]. It preserves your agent&#8217;s public identity (like the name &#8216;Otto&#8217;) while removing sensitive details from memory files and credentials. The skill always previews what will be shared before uploading, giving you full control over your data.</p>
<h2>Community Benefits</h2>
<p>By sharing your configurations, you contribute to a growing library of agent setups that others can learn from. The community browsing feature lets you search by keywords, sort by popularity, and discover innovative automation patterns. The suggest command provides personalized recommendations based on your current workspace, helping you discover new capabilities and workflows you might not have considered.</p>
<h2>Technical Requirements</h2>
<p>The skill requires Node.js to run and optionally uses Ollama with a local LLM model like LiquidAI&#8217;s LFM2.5 for better summary generation. All shared data is stored on opensoul.cloud with your handle serving as your public identity. Credentials are securely stored locally in ~/.opensoul/credentials.json.</p>
<h2>Who Should Use It</h2>
<p>OpenSoul is perfect for OpenClaw users who want to share their agent configurations, discover new automation patterns, or get inspiration for expanding their agent&#8217;s capabilities. Whether you&#8217;re a beginner looking for examples or an experienced user wanting to contribute to the community, OpenSoul provides the tools to connect with other OpenClaw enthusiasts while keeping your private information secure.</p>
