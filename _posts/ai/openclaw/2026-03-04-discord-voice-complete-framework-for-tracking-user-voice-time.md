<h2>What is Discord Voice?</h2>
<p>Discord Voice is a complete framework designed to facilitate the tracking of user voice time in Discord servers using discord.js. This powerful npm package provides developers with the tools they need to monitor, analyze, and utilize voice activity data within their Discord communities.</p>
<h2>How Discord Voice Works</h2>
<p>The framework operates by integrating seamlessly with discord.js, the popular Node.js module for interacting with the Discord API. Here&#8217;s a breakdown of how it functions:</p>
<h3>Voice Activity Detection</h3>
<p>Discord Voice continuously monitors voice channels for user activity. When a user joins a voice channel, the framework begins tracking their voice time. It can detect when users are actively speaking, muted, or deafened, providing granular data about voice channel usage.</p>
<h3>Data Collection and Storage</h3>
<p>The framework collects detailed metrics including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Total voice time per user</li>
<li>Time spent in specific voice channels</li>
<li>Speaking vs. muted time ratios</li>
<li>Peak usage hours</li>
<li>Voice channel popularity rankings</li>
</ul>
<p>This data is typically stored in a database for persistent tracking across bot restarts and server sessions.</p>
<h3>Event Handling</h3>
<p>Discord Voice provides event handlers for various voice-related actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>User joins voice channel</li>
<li>User leaves voice channel</li>
<li>User starts/stops speaking</li>
<li>User mutes/unmutes</li>
<li>User deafens/undeafens</li>
</ul>
<h2>Key Features</h2>
<h3>Voice Time Leaderboards</h3>
<p>One of the most popular features is the ability to create voice time leaderboards. These display top users based on their accumulated voice time, fostering friendly competition within the community.</p>
<h3>Voice Channel Analytics</h3>
<p>Discord Voice provides detailed analytics about voice channel usage, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most active channels</li>
<li>Average user count per channel</li>
<li>Peak activity times</li>
<li>Channel retention rates</li>
</ul>
<h3>Role-Based Voice Time Rewards</h3>
<p>Many communities use voice time as a basis for role rewards. Discord Voice can automatically assign roles based on accumulated voice time thresholds, creating a gamification system that encourages community engagement.</p>
<h3>Voice Time-Based Commands</h3>
<p>The framework allows for custom commands that check user voice time. For example, a command might show how long a user has been in voice channels today, or compare voice time between users.</p>
<h2>Use Cases</h2>
<h3>Community Management</h3>
<p>Discord Voice helps community managers understand how their members interact within voice channels. This data can inform decisions about server organization, moderation, and community events.</p>
<h3>Gamification</h3>
<p>Many Discord servers use voice time as a gamification element. By tracking voice time, communities can create achievement systems, reward active members, and encourage participation.</p>
<h3>Content Creator Analytics</h3>
<p>For servers with content creators, Discord Voice provides valuable analytics about audience engagement during streams or voice-based content creation sessions.</p>
<h3>Event Planning</h3>
<p>Voice time data helps in planning community events by identifying peak activity times and understanding which voice channels are most popular for different types of interactions.</p>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<h3>Enhanced Community Engagement</h3>
<p>By tracking and rewarding voice activity, Discord Voice helps create more engaging communities where members are motivated to participate in voice conversations.</p>
<h3>Data-Driven Decision Making</h3>
<p>The analytics provided by Discord Voice enable server administrators to make informed decisions about server structure, moderation policies, and community events based on actual usage data.</p>
<h3>Fair Recognition System</h3>
<p>Voice time tracking provides an objective way to recognize and reward active community members, reducing potential bias in recognition systems.</p>
<h3>Improved User Experience</h3>
<p>By understanding voice channel usage patterns, server administrators can optimize their server layout and create better experiences for their members.</p>
<h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>Discord Voice is available as an npm package and can be easily installed using:</p>
<pre><code>npm install discord-voice
