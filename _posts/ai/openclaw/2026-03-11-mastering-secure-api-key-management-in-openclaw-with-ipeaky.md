<h1>Introduction to ipeaky: The Gold Standard for OpenClaw API Management</h1>
<p>In the world of AI agents and local automation, managing API keys is a constant security headache. Whether you are using OpenAI for whisper transcription, ElevenLabs for voice synthesis, or Brave for search, keeping those keys safe while maintaining a seamless user experience is paramount. Enter <strong>ipeaky</strong>, the native OpenClaw skill designed specifically for secure API key lifecycle management. This guide will walk you through why ipeaky is essential, how it handles your credentials, and how you can use it to maintain a rock-solid security posture.</p>
<h2>What is ipeaky?</h2>
<p>ipeaky is a specialized skill for the OpenClaw framework that serves as a dedicated security layer for API configuration. Its primary objective is to facilitate the storage, listing, testing, and deletion of API keys while ensuring they never appear in your chat history, terminal logs, or shell history. By leveraging OpenClaw’s native <code>openclaw.json</code> file, ipeaky ensures that keys are integrated directly into the gateway configuration, making them immediately available to any skill that requires them via primary environment variables.</p>
<h2>The Core Security Philosophy: Zero Exposure</h2>
<p>The most dangerous place for an API key is in plain text. Whether it is typed into a chat window or echoed in a terminal, those characters are stored in history files, potentially leaking your paid credits or data access. ipeaky solves this by utilizing secure input popups (on macOS via <code>osascript</code>) and pipe-based ingestion. By bypassing the chat interface entirely, ipeaky ensures that keys move directly from your clipboard to the secure <code>openclaw.json</code> file.</p>
<h2>How to Store Keys Like a Pro</h2>
<p>ipeaky provides several tiers of storage, with the current recommendation being the <strong>v4 Single Paste method</strong>. This method is revolutionary because it allows you to copy-paste entire blocks of API configuration—regardless of their format—and let the local Python regex engine parse the keys. Because this happens locally on your machine with no network involvement, your sensitive data never leaves your environment. To use this, you simply run the script provided in the <code>baseDir/scripts/</code> folder, passing the service name and the config path as arguments. The system displays a confirmation, you hit enter, and the gateway reloads with your new, encrypted, or natively stored keys ready for use.</p>
<h2>Automated Key Injection</h2>
<p>One of the most elegant aspects of ipeaky is its integration with OpenClaw’s environment variable injection. You do not need to manually source credentials or copy them into every individual skill folder. Once you have stored a key like the OpenAI API key, ipeaky automatically maps it to <code>OPENAI_API_KEY</code>. If a skill like <code>openai-whisper-api</code> or <code>openai-image-gen</code> is triggered, it simply inherits the key directly from the gateway’s memory. This &#8216;configure once, use everywhere&#8217; approach eliminates the configuration drift that plagues many other automation setups.</p>
<h2>Listing and Validating Credentials</h2>
<p>Security is not just about storage; it is about visibility. With ipeaky, you can audit your setup without compromising your keys. By running the listing command, ipeaky reads your live configuration and provides a masked view of your keys (e.g., <code>sk-1234****</code>). This allows you to verify that keys are set for the correct services without ever revealing the full sensitive string to the terminal output. Furthermore, the built-in testing tools use specialized <code>curl</code> commands to ping specific API endpoints—like ElevenLabs or Anthropic—to confirm validity, reporting only a &#8216;Success&#8217; or &#8216;Failure&#8217; result.</p>
<h2>Handling Multiple Services</h2>
<p>A common pain point is managing multiple keys for different providers. ipeaky makes this easy. For example, when setting up Brave Search, you map the token directly to <code>tools.web.search.apiKey</code>. For more complex setups like ElevenLabs, where keys are needed for both the &#8216;sag&#8217; and &#8216;talk&#8217; modules, ipeaky handles multiple paths simultaneously, ensuring that one save command propagates the credentials across every module that requires them. This is managed via the <code>gateway config.patch</code> mechanism, which atomizes the configuration change.</p>
<h2>The Future: Paid Tier and Beyond</h2>
<p>While ipeaky provides robust local protection, the developers are actively working on a premium, paid tier for power users and teams. This upcoming iteration will introduce features like team-based key sharing, which is a massive milestone for professional organizations using OpenClaw. Additional features will include automated key rotation reminders—ensuring you don&#8217;t run into outages due to expired tokens—and breach monitoring, which will alert you if your credentials appear in known leak databases. Backup and sync features will also provide encrypted, cloud-based recovery, ensuring that your agent&#8217;s infrastructure remains resilient.</p>
<h2>Conclusion: Why You Should Use ipeaky</h2>
<p>If you are serious about building an agentic workflow in OpenClaw, security cannot be an afterthought. ipeaky provides the necessary infrastructure to treat your API keys as sensitive assets, not just configuration strings. By adopting the secure input and native storage methods offered by ipeaky, you protect your wallet and your data privacy. The days of pasting keys into chat windows and hoping for the best are over. With ipeaky, you have a streamlined, professional-grade secret management system that runs locally and keeps your automation environment clean, safe, and highly efficient.</p>
<h3>Quick Reference Checklist:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Always use the v4 scripts for batch input.</li>
<li>Never type keys directly into the chat interface.</li>
<li>Regularly audit your masked keys using the list command.</li>
<li>Ensure that you update all relevant config paths when refreshing a key for multi-skill services.</li>
