<h1>Explaining OpenClaw&#8217;s Canary Skill: A Comprehensive Guide to Secret Leak Detection</h1>
<p>In today&#39;s digital landscape, safeguarding sensitive information such as API keys, tokens, and credentials is paramount. OpenClaw&#39;s Canary skill is designed to be your early warning system, diligently scanning your environment for any exposed secrets. This comprehensive guide will illuminate the functionality, detection methods, and auto-fix capabilities of the Canary skill&#46;</p>
<h2>Understanding OpenClaw&#8217;s Canary Skill</h2>
<p>The Canary skill is a powerful tool that operates in two distinct modes: Light Scan and Deep Scan. Let&#39;s delve into each of these modes and understand how they contribute to protecting your environment.</p>
<h3>Light Scan: The Automatic Check</h3>
<p>Every time OpenClaw starts, the Light Scan mode kicks into action. This mode performs a swift and silent check of critical locations:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#39;~/.openclaw/.env&#39; and &#39;~/.clawdbot/.env&#39; for plaintext credentials</li>
<li>File permissions on config files containing secrets (world-readable = bad)</li>
<li>Any .env files in the active workspace</li>
</ul>
<p>If everything checks out, Canary remains silent, ensuring a smooth and uninterrupted operation. However, if any issues are detected, Canary will display a short alert, providing the option to fix the problem or obtain more details.</p>
<h3>Deep Scan: The Comprehensive Check</h3>
<p>The Deep Scan mode can be manually triggered whenever you desire a thorough security check. This mode covers everything checked in the Light Scan and extends to:</p>
<ul>
<li>All installed skill directories for hardcoded secrets</li>
<li>Session/chat history files for accidentally pasted credentials</li>
<li>Git repositories in the workspace for committed secrets</li>
<li>SSH keys and config (~/.ssh/) for weak permissions</li>
<li>Shell history files for commands containing tokens or passwords</li>
<li>Known credential file paths (.netrc, .npmrc, .pypirc, Docker config, AWS credentials, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Detecting Secrets: What Canary Looks For</h2>
<p>Canary employs pattern matching and heuristic checks to identify various types of secrets. Let&#39;s explore the different secret types, examples, and the locations where Canary looks for them.</p>

<h2>Severity Levels: Prioritizing Your Security</h2>
<p>Each finding in the Canary scan is assigned a clear severity level to help you prioritize your security efforts:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#39;&#8217;tissues found&#39;: First time Canary runs: show a brief all-clear so the user knows it&#39;s active. Example: &#39;ðŸ�¦ Canary checked your environment â€” everything looks clean.&#39;</li>
<li>&#39;&#8217;issues found&#39;: display a single line with the total count of issues found, allowing users to take immediate action.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Auto-Fix: Streamlining Your Security Efforts</h2>
<p>Canary’s auto-fix feature is designed to streamline your security efforts by automatically addressing identified issues. However, it’s essential to note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Canary will never change, move, or delete anything on your system without your explicit confirmation.</li>
<li>Every auto-fix is shown to you in full before it happens. You can always say no, and Canary will provide a step-by-step guide to address the issue manually.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Issue Resolution: What Canary Will Do (with your OK)</h3>
<p>Canary offers seamless solutions to common issues, making the process of securing your environment a breeze. Let’s explore some of these auto-fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#39;Your .env file can be read by other users on this machine&#39;: Make the file private to your account only.</li>
<li>&#39;Secret pasted in your shell history&#39;: Remove that one line from your history.</li>
<li>&#39;SSH key file isn&#39;t locked down&#39;: Restrict the key file to your account only.</li>
<li>&#39;API key hardcoded inside a skill&#39;: Move the key to your .env file and reference it from there.</li>
<li>&#39;Secret committed to a git repo&#39;: Add the file to .gitignore so it won&#39;t be shared again.</li>
<li>&#39;Credential file sitting in Downloads/Desktop/Documents&#39;: Move the file to a secure location with private permissions.</li>
<li>&#39;Kubernetes config with embedded tokens is too open&#39;: Make the config file private to your account.</li>
<li>&#39;Terraform state file with plaintext secrets&#39;: Flag and restrict file permissions.</li>
<li>&#39;Database config with embedded password&#39;: Restrict the config file to your account only.</li>
<li>&#39;Browser password export CSV left unprotected&#39;: Move to a secure location or securely delete.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Backup Security: Ensuring Data Integrity</h2>
<p>Before every fix, Canary creates a backup of the affected file at &#39;&lt;workspace&gt;/.<canary&gt;/backups/&#39; with a timestamp (e.g., &#39;<en></v><env.2026-02-07T14:30:00.bak&#39;). If anything goes wrong, you can ask Canary to roll back the changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#39;Canary, undo that last fix&#39;</li>
<li>&#39;Restore my .env file&#39;</li>
</ul>
<p>Backup security is paramount to Canary. Here&#39;s how Canary ensures the safety of your backups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Backups are encrypted at rest using a key derived from the machine&#39;s unique identifier. They cannot be read by simply opening the file â€” only Canary&#39;s rollback process can decrypt them.</li>
<li>Canary &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; scans its own backup directory. The path <workspace&gt;/.<canary>/backups/ is permanently excluded from all scans to avoid false feedback loops where Canary re-flags the secrets it just backed up.</li>
<li>The backup directory is created with owner-only permissions (700). If another process changes these permissions, Canary will alert the user on the next startup.</li>
<li>Backups older than 7 days are securely deleted (overwritten before removal) rather than simply unlinked.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions for the Agent: A Step-by-Step Guide</h2>
<p>As the Canary security skill, your primary responsibility is to protect the user&#39;s secrets and credentials. Here&#39;s a step-by-step guide on how to perform a Light Scan on startup:</p>
<ol>
<li>&#39;On Startup (Light Scan)&#39;: Silently check these locations: &#39;~/.openclaw/.env&#39;, &#39;~/.clawdbot/.env&#39;, and any &#39;.env&#39; in the current workspace.</li>
<li>&#39;File permissions on all config files found above&#39;</li>
<li>&#39;If no issues found&#39;:</li>
<ol>
<li>First time Canary runs: show a brief all-clear so the user knows it&#39;s active. Example: &#39;ðŸ�¦ Canary checked your environment â€” everything looks clean.&#39;<l/li>
<li>Every startup after that: stay silent. No news is good news.</li>
</ol>
<li>&#39;If issues found&#39;: display a single line with the total count of issues found, allowing users to take immediate action.</li>
</ol>
