<h2>Understanding BlackSwan Risk Intelligence</h2>
<p>BlackSwan delivers real-time crypto risk intelligence that helps traders and investors navigate volatile markets by providing early warning signals and comprehensive market assessments. The system operates 24/7, monitoring crypto markets and producing two distinct types of risk assessments that serve different but complementary purposes.</p>
<h3>The Two-Tool Approach</h3>
<p>BlackSwan employs a dual-tool strategy designed to address different aspects of market risk. The first tool, Flare, focuses on immediate risk detection through a 15-minute signal window, providing precursor detection before major market events occur. The second tool, Core, offers a broader 60-minute state synthesis that evaluates the overall market context and risk environment.</p>
<p>This two-pronged approach allows users to choose the right tool for their specific needs. Whether you&#8217;re looking for immediate alerts about sudden market movements or a comprehensive risk briefing that considers multiple factors, BlackSwan provides the appropriate intelligence.</p>
<h3>When to Use Each Tool</h3>
<p>The choice between Flare and Core depends on your specific question or concern. If you&#8217;re asking &#8220;Is something happening right now?&#8221; or &#8220;Should I be worried about sudden moves?&#8221; then Flare is your best option. It&#8217;s designed for immediate, alarm-bell risk checks that detect precursors before news breaks.</p>
<p>For questions like &#8220;What&#8217;s the overall market risk environment?&#8221; or &#8220;Give me a full risk briefing,&#8221; you&#8217;ll want to use Core. This tool provides market context and risk assessment by synthesizing information from a longer time window. For the most comprehensive understanding, the recommended pattern is to call both endpoints, starting with Flare for immediate risks and then Core for broader context.</p>
<h3>Base URL and Endpoints</h3>
<p>BlackSwan operates through a simple API structure accessible at <a href="https://mcp.blackswan.wtf">https://mcp.blackswan.wtf</a>. The system offers two primary endpoints: GET /api/flare for the latest Flare precursor detection assessment, and GET /api/core for the latest Core state synthesis assessment.</p>
<p>Both endpoints return JSON responses with standardized fields, making integration straightforward for developers and automated systems. The API requires no authentication for basic access, allowing users to retrieve the last analysis without API keys.</p>
<h3>Flare Endpoint Details</h3>
<p>The Flare endpoint returns comprehensive information about immediate market conditions. Key response fields include the agent identifier (always &#8220;flare&#8221;), data_age showing how fresh the information is (e.g., &#8220;12 minutes ago&#8221;), and the status which can be either &#8220;clear&#8221; or &#8220;alert&#8221;.</p>
<p>The severity field provides a quick risk assessment using five levels: none, low, medium, high, or critical. The checked_at timestamp shows when the assessment was performed, while the assessment field contains a natural language description of the current risk situation.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, Flare includes an array of detected signals, each with type, source, and detail fields that explain exactly what triggered the assessment. This granular information helps users understand the specific factors contributing to the current risk level.</p>
<h3>Core Endpoint Details</h3>
<p>The Core endpoint provides a more comprehensive market analysis. Like Flare, it includes an agent identifier (always &#8220;core&#8221;), data_age, and timestamp fields. However, Core introduces the environment field, which categorizes the overall market conditions as stable, elevated, stressed, or crisis.</p>
<p>The assessment field offers a natural language overview of the current market situation, while key_factors provides an array of strings describing the main risk factors identified in the analysis. The sources_used field lists all data sources incorporated into the assessment, and data_freshness describes how current the underlying information is.</p>
<h3>Interpreting Severity Levels</h3>
<p>Understanding the severity levels in Flare responses is crucial for proper risk assessment. A severity of &#8220;none&#8221; indicates no precursors detected and quiet markets, while &#8220;low&#8221; suggests minor signals that are worth noting but not immediately actionable.</p>
<p>Medium severity represents notable signals that warrant attention, high severity indicates strong precursors detected with elevated risk of sudden moves, and critical severity signals extreme conditions with immediate risk of major market events. These graduated levels help users quickly gauge the urgency of the situation.</p>
<h3>Interpreting Environment Levels</h3>
<p>Core&#8217;s environment levels provide a broader perspective on market conditions. A &#8220;stable&#8221; environment indicates normal market conditions with low systemic risk, while &#8220;elevated&#8221; suggests above-normal risk with some stress indicators present.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stressed&#8221; environments show significant stress across multiple indicators, and &#8220;crisis&#8221; environments indicate severe market stress with active dislocation or contagion. These levels help users understand the broader market context beyond immediate price movements.</p>
<h3>Error Handling and Reliability</h3>
<p>BlackSwan implements robust error handling to ensure users understand system status. HTTP 200 responses indicate successful operations with full assessment data. HTTP 502 errors suggest agent output failed validation, possibly due to format changes.</p>
<p>HTTP 503 errors indicate no recent agent runs, suggesting the system may be starting up or experiencing temporary issues. HTTP 500 errors represent unexpected server errors. On any non-200 response, the body returns a JSON object with an error field containing a human-readable message.</p>
<h3>Complete Risk Check Pattern</h3>
<p>For the most comprehensive market assessment, BlackSwan recommends a specific calling pattern. First, retrieve the Flare assessment to understand immediate risks and potential precursors. Then, follow up with the Core assessment to get the broader market context and state synthesis.</p>
<p>This two-step approach ensures you capture both the immediate, actionable intelligence from Flare and the comprehensive market understanding from Core. The pattern can be implemented with simple curl commands:</p>
<pre><code>curl -s https://mcp.blackswan.wtf/api/flare
curl -s https://mcp.blackswan.wtf/api/core
</code></pre>
<p>By presenting Flare results first, users get immediate risk information, followed by Core&#8217;s contextual analysis for a complete picture of the crypto market landscape.</p>
<h3>Free Access and Upgrade Options</h3>
<p>BlackSwan offers free access to its last analysis without requiring API keys, making it accessible for casual users and those wanting to test the service. For users needing more advanced features, the system provides an upgrade path to x402 for custom analysis capabilities.</p>
<p>This tiered approach allows users to start with basic monitoring and scale up to more sophisticated analysis as their needs evolve. The combination of free access and premium options makes BlackSwan suitable for both individual traders and institutional investors.</p>
<h3>Technical Requirements</h3>
<p>The system requires basic command-line tools for integration, with curl being the primary dependency for API calls. The responses are delivered in JSON format, making them easy to parse and integrate into existing systems or custom applications.</p>
<p>The straightforward API design and lack of authentication requirements for basic access lower the barrier to entry, allowing users to quickly start monitoring crypto market risks without complex setup procedures.</p>
