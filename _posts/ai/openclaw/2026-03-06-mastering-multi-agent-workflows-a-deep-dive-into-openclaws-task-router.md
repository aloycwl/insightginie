<h2>Introduction to OpenClaw Task Routing</h2>
<p>In the evolving landscape of multi-agent systems, the complexity of managing parallel workloads often becomes the primary bottleneck. As your system scales from a single agent to a cluster of specialized assistants, you need more than just a queue—you need a smart coordinator. Enter the <strong>Task Router</strong>, a powerful skill for the OpenClaw ecosystem designed to handle distributed task queues and agent orchestration with ease.</p>
<h2>What is the Task Router?</h2>
<p>The Task Router is essentially the traffic control center for your OpenClaw environment. It allows you to define specialized agents—each with unique capabilities—and ensures that tasks are routed to the agent most qualified to perform the work. Whether you are generating images, performing deep research, or running complex data analyses, the Task Router handles the entire lifecycle: from creation and assignment to monitoring and dead-letter management.</p>
<h2>Core Functionalities</h2>
<p>The power of the Task Router lies in its automated, intelligent design. Here is how it fundamentally changes your workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capability-Based Routing:</strong> Instead of manually assigning work, the router looks at your agent&#8217;s registered capabilities (e.g., &#8216;research&#8217;, &#8216;analysis&#8217;, &#8216;image_gen&#8217;) and matches them with incoming tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Asynchronous Coordination:</strong> You can spawn work from a main session without blocking it, allowing your agents to operate independently and asynchronously.</li>
<li><strong>Lifecycle Management:</strong> Every task has a defined state—pending, active, completed, or failed—allowing for granular oversight.</li>
<li><strong>Automatic Rebalancing:</strong> If a task hangs or an agent fails, the router detects this and attempts to reassign or retry the work based on your custom failure policies.</li>
<li><strong>Dead Letter Handling:</strong> Tasks that exhaust all retry attempts are moved to a dead-letter queue, ensuring no request is ever truly lost and allowing for manual inspection.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Getting Started: A Quick Guide</h2>
<p>Setting up the Task Router is remarkably straightforward within the OpenClaw environment. After installation using <code>clawhub install task-router</code>, you can begin registering agents immediately.</p>
<pre># Register an agent with specific capabilities
task agent register watson --capabilities "research analysis" --max-concurrent 3</pre>
<p>Once your agents are registered, creating a task is as simple as running a single command:</p>
<pre># Create a high-priority research task
task create --type research --title "Competitor Analysis" --priority high</pre>
<h2>Advanced Configuration Strategies</h2>
<p>One of the most impressive features of the Task Router is the flexibility found in the <code>config.yaml</code> file. Administrators can define specific load-balancing strategies per task type. For example, you can choose <code>least-loaded</code> for research tasks to ensure no single agent is overwhelmed, while using <code>round-robin</code> for image generation tasks.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the health monitoring system is robust. By setting an <code>agent_timeout</code>, the system automatically marks agents as unhealthy if they stop pinging the router, ensuring the task pool remains healthy and active at all times.</p>
<h2>Why Developers Need the Task Router</h2>
<p>For developers building multi-agent systems, the Task Router solves the &#8220;orchestration tax.&#8221; Without it, you are forced to write boilerplate code to handle inter-process communication, error retries, and task persistence. The Task Router abstracts all of this into a simple command-line interface and a clean programmatic SDK.</p>
<p>By using the Task SDK, you can easily integrate these patterns into your custom JavaScript code:</p>
<pre>import * as Task from "~/.openclaw/task-router/sdk";

// Create a task programmatically
const task = await Task.create({
  type: "research",
  title: "Competitor analysis",
  payload: { query: "Market trends 2026" }
});</pre>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The OpenClaw Task Router is an indispensable tool for anyone moving beyond simple chat-based AI into the realm of complex, agent-driven operations. By decoupling task definition from task execution, it provides the scalability and reliability required for production-grade AI systems. Whether you are managing a small set of local agents or a large, distributed fleet, the Task Router provides the control, visibility, and automation you need to keep your workflows moving efficiently.</p>
