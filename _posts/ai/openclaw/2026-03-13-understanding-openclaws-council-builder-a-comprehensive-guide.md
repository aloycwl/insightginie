<h1>Understanding OpenClaw&#8217;s Council Builder: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
<p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, tools that can automate and enhance workflows are becoming increasingly essential. OpenClaw, a cutting-edge platform, offers a range of skills designed to meet various user needs. One such skill is the <strong>Council Builder</strong>, which enables users to create a personalized team of AI agent personas tailored to their specific workflows. This article delves into the intricacies of the Council Builder skill, explaining its purpose, workflow, and key principles.</p>
<h2>What is the Council Builder Skill?</h2>
<p>The Council Builder skill in OpenClaw is designed to help users build a team of specialized AI agent personas. These agents are created based on the user&#8217;s actual needs, with each agent having a distinct personality, self-improvement capability, and clear coordination rules. The Council Builder skill is particularly useful when users want to create an agent team, build specialized AI personas, or set up multi-agent workflows.</p>
<h2>Workflow of the Council Builder Skill</h2>
<p>The Council Builder skill follows a structured workflow divided into several phases:</p>
<h3>Phase 1: Discovery</h3>
<p>In the Discovery phase, the skill interviews the user to understand their world. This involves asking a series of questions in batches of 2-3 to gather essential information. The questions are divided into rounds:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Round 1 &#8211; Identity:</strong> What do you do? (profession, main activities, industry) What tools and platforms do you use daily?</li>
<li><strong>Round 2 &#8211; Pain Points:</strong> What tasks eat most of your time? Where do you feel you need the most help?</li>
<li><strong>Round 3 &#8211; Preferences:</strong> What language(s) do you work in? (for agent communication style) Any specific domains you want covered? (coding, content, finance, research, scheduling, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>If the user has existing OpenClaw history, the skill also scans for patterns in memory, files, workspace structure, and installed skills. This phase aims to gather as much information as possible before proceeding to the next phase.</p>
<h3>Phase 2: Planning</h3>
<p>Based on the discovery, the skill designs the council by determining the agent count, defining each agent&#8217;s role, specialties, personality angle, and mapping coordination. The plan is presented to the user in a clear table format, and explicit approval is required before proceeding to the building phase. The skill also emphasizes the importance of naming agents with memorable, short names that hint at their role but feel like characters.</p>
<h3>Phase 3: Building</h3>
<p>In the Building phase, the skill runs the initialization script to create the directory skeleton and then populates the files for each approved agent. Each agent has a directory structure that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>SOUL.md: Personality, role, rules</li>
<li>AGENTS.md: Agent-specific coordination rules</li>
<li>memory/: Agent&#8217;s memory directory</li>
<li>.learnings/: Self-improvement logs</li>
<li>[workspace dirs]: Role-specific output directories</li>
</ul>
<p>The skill emphasizes the importance of customizing each agent&#8217;s SOUL.md deeply for their role and personality, ensuring that every SOUL is unique. It also sets up coordination rules, self-improvement logs, and adaptive model routing thresholds.</p>
<h3>Phase 4: Adaptive Routing Setup</h3>
<p>The skill sets up an adaptive routing section in the root AGENTS.md, including default to Fast, escalation thresholds for Think, Deep, Strategic, de-escalation rules, and high-tier model rate-limit fallback behavior. It also creates a visual architecture document using a template.</p>
<h3>Phase 5: Self-Improvement Setup</h3>
<p>The skill ensures that each agent has built-in self-improvement capabilities, including a .learnings directory with proper templates, detection triggers in SOUL.md, promotion rules, cross-agent learning sharing, and periodic review instructions. It also sets up a weekly learning metrics file.</p>
<h3>Phase 6: Verification</h3>
<p>After building everything, the skill lists all created files for the user, shows the routing table and coordination map, and confirms that everything is in place.</p>
<h3>Phase 7: Expansion (On-Demand)</h3>
<p>When the user asks to add, modify, or remove agents, the skill follows a process similar to the building phase, ensuring that the changes are carried out smoothly and efficiently.</p>
<h2>Key Principles of the Council Builder Skill</h2>
<p>The Council Builder skill adheres to several key principles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Character, not template:</strong> Each agent is a character with a different personality, voice, and strengths. If two agents sound the same, one shouldn&#8217;t exist.</li>
<li><strong>No corporate language:</strong> There should be no corporate language in any SOUL. This is non-negotiable.</li>
<li><strong>Self-improvement is mandatory:</strong> Every agent logs mistakes and learns. Self-improvement is a core feature.</li>
<li><strong>Coordination through files:</strong> Agents communicate via shared directories, not direct messaging. Each agent has clear read/write boundaries.</li>
<li><strong>Brevity in everything:</strong> SOULs, AGENTS files, and templates should be brief and respect the context window.</li>
<li><strong>The user&#8217;s main assistant is the coordinator:</strong> It routes tasks, not the agents themselves.</li>
<li><strong>Language-adaptive:</strong> Write SOULs in whatever language the user works in, whether it&#8217;s Arabic, English, bilingual, or any other language.</li>
<li><strong>Adaptive routing by default:</strong> Every generated council should include Fast/Think/Deep/Strategic model routing thresholds.</li>
<li><strong>Metrics over vibes:</strong> Weekly learning review must be measured in memory/learning-metrics.json.</li>
<li><strong>Architecture must be visual:</strong> Generate a concise architecture document for training and onboarding.</li>
</ul>
<h2>When to Use the Council Builder Skill</h2>
<p>The Council Builder skill is particularly useful when users want to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an agent team or council</li>
<li>Build specialized AI personas</li>
<li>Set up multi-agent workflows</li>
<li>Build a team of agents</li>
<li>Create agents for their workflow</li>
<li>Set up an agent council</li>
<li>Have specialized AI assistants</li>
<li>Build a crew of agents</li>
</ul>
<p>However, it is not recommended for users looking for a single skill (skill-creator), wanting to install existing skills (clawhub), or wanting to chat with existing agents (just route to them).</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Council Builder skill in OpenClaw is a powerful tool for creating personalized AI agent teams tailored to user workflows and needs. By following a structured workflow and adhering to key principles, the skill ensures that each agent is unique, capable of self-improvement, and communicates effectively with other agents. Whether you are looking to build an agent team, create specialized AI personas, or set up multi-agent workflows, the Council Builder skill is an excellent choice to enhance your productivity and automation capabilities.</p>
