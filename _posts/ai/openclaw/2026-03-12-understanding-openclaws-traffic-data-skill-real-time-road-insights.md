OpenClaw&#8217;s Traffic Data Skill is a powerful tool designed to query and analyze traffic data, including real-time road conditions, traffic incidents, and SCATS intersection data. This skill leverages advanced APIs from leading mapping services to provide accurate and up-to-date traffic information, making it an essential resource for developers and users alike.</p>
<h2>What is OpenClaw&#8217;s Traffic Data Skill?</h2>
<p>OpenClaw&#8217;s Traffic Data Skill is an innovative tool that allows users to query traffic data in real-time. It supports a range of functionalities, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Real-Time Road Conditions:</strong> Monitor the current state of roads, including traffic congestion, speed limits, and road closures.</li>
<li><strong>Traffic Incidents:</strong> Stay informed about accidents, roadworks, and other incidents that may affect traffic flow.</li>
<li><strong>SCATS Intersection Data:</strong> Access detailed data on traffic signals and intersection management through the SCATS system.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Setting Up the Traffic Data Skill</h2>
<p>To use the Traffic Data Skill, you need to set up the required environment variables. These include API keys from Baidu Map, Gaode Map, and SCATS. Here&#8217;s how you can configure them:</p>
<pre><code># Baidu Map API (optional)
BAIDU_MAP_KEY=your-baidu-map-api-key

# Gaode Map API (optional)
GAODE_MAP_KEY=your-gaode-map-api-key

# SCATS Data API (if available)
SCATS_API_KEY=your-scats-api-key</code></pre>
<h2>Functionalities of the Traffic Data Skill</h2>
<p>The Traffic Data Skill offers several functionalities to cater to different user needs:</p>
<h3>1. Real-Time Road Conditions</h3>
<p>To query real-time road conditions, use the following command:</p>
<pre><code>node skills/traffic-data/road.js &lt;city&gt; &lt;road-name&gt;</code></pre>
<p>For example, to check the real-time road conditions in Guangzhou on Guangzhou Avenue, you would use:</p>
<pre><code>node skills/traffic-data/road.js 广州 广州大道</code></pre>
<p>This command fetches the latest traffic data for the specified road, providing valuable insights into traffic congestion, speed limits, and other relevant information.</p>
<h3>2. Traffic Incident Query</h3>
<p>To query traffic incidents in a specific city, use the following command:</p>
<pre><code>node skills/traffic-data/incident.js &lt;city&gt;</code></pre>
<p>For example, to check traffic incidents in Guangzhou, you would use:</p>
<pre><code>node skills/traffic-data/incident.js 广州</code></pre>
<p>This command retrieves the latest traffic incident data for the specified city, including accidents, roadworks, and other incidents that may affect traffic flow.</p>
<h3>3. SCATS Intersection Data Query</h3>
<p>To query SCATS intersection data, use the following command:</p>
<pre><code>node skills/traffic-data/scats.js &lt;intersection-number&gt;</code></pre>
<p>For example, to check the SCATS intersection data for intersection number 001, you would use:</p>
<pre><code>node skills/traffic-data/scats.js 001</code></pre>
<p>This command fetches detailed data on traffic signals and intersection management for the specified intersection, providing valuable insights into traffic signal timings, pedestrian crossing data, and more.</p>
