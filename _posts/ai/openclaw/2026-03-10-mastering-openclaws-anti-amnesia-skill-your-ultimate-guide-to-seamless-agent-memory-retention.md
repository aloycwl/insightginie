<h1>Mastering OpenClaw&#8217;s Anti-Amnesia Skill: Your Ultimate Guide to Seamless Agent Memory Retention</h1>
<p>In the ever-evolving landscape of AI and automation, OpenClaw has emerged as a powerful platform for creating autonomous agents. One of the key challenges in agent development is ensuring that agents retain their context and memory across different sessions. This is where OpenClaw&#8217;s Anti-Amnesia Skill comes into play. In this comprehensive guide, we&#8217;ll delve into what this skill does and how it can revolutionize your agent&#8217;s memory retention.</p>
<h2>Understanding the Anti-Amnesia Skill</h2>
<p>The Anti-Amnesia Skill is designed to provide a complete memory retention system for OpenClaw agents. It addresses the common issue of context loss across sessions, ensuring that your agent wakes up with all its knowledge intact every time. This skill is a game-changer for developers looking to create more robust and reliable autonomous agents.</p>
<h2>Core Components of the Anti-Amnesia Skill</h2>
<h3>1. STATE.md</h3>
<p>This file serves as the single source of truth for your agent. It contains active projects, iron decisions, and open issues. Every time your agent wakes up, it reads this file first, ensuring that it is always up-to-date with the current world state.</p>
<h3>2. Session Memory Hook</h3>
<p>The session memory hook automatically saves the full conversation history when you use the /new or /reset commands. This feature ensures that there is zero manual work required to retain session memory, making it incredibly user-friendly.</p>
<h3>3. Daily Journals</h3>
<p>The Anti-Amnesia Skill also includes a feature for creating daily journals. These journals, stored as memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md files, capture everything that happens each day. This structured approach to memory retention helps in organizing and retrieving information efficiently.</p>
<h3>4. MEMORY.md</h3>
<p>This file is a long-term curated memory that contains distilled wisdom rather than raw logs. It acts as a repository of long-term memory, ensuring that your agent retains critical knowledge over extended periods.</p>
<h3>5. Heartbeat Health Checks</h3>
<p>Every time your agent wakes up, it performs heartbeat health checks. These checks verify crons, check processes, and validate state consistency. This proactive approach to health monitoring ensures that your agent remains in optimal working condition.</p>
<h3>6. Decision Capture</h3>
<p>Decisions made in conversation are immediately written to files. This feature eliminates the risk of lost decisions and ensures that your agent maintains a record of all critical choices.</p>
<h2>Setting Up the Anti-Amnesia Skill</h2>
<h3>Step 1: Enable Session Memory Hook</h3>
<p>To enable the session memory hook, you need to add the following configuration to your ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json file under the hooks section:</p>
<pre><code>{<br>  "hooks": {<br>    "session-memory": {<br>      "enabled": true,<br>      "messages": 9999,<br>      "path": "memory/"<br>    }<br>  }<br>}</code></pre>
<h3>Step 2: Create Core Files</h3>
<p>Next, you need to copy the necessary templates from the skill&#8217;s templates folder to your workspace. This includes the STATE.md and HEARTBEAT.md files. You should edit the STATE.md file with your actual projects and decisions.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Update AGENTS.md</h3>
<p>Update your AGENTS.md file to include the session start protocol. This ensures that your agent reads the STATE.md, memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md, and MEMORY.md files at the start of every session.</p>
<h3>Step 4: Create memory directory</h3>
<p>Finally, create a memory directory to store your daily journals and other memory files. You can do this by running the following command:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir -p workspace/memory</code></pre>
<h2>The Anti-Amnesia Protocol</h2>
<p>The Anti-Amnesia Protocol is a set of guidelines that your agent follows to ensure seamless memory retention. Here&#8217;s a breakdown of what happens at different stages:</p>
<h3>On Every Session Start:</h3>
<ul>
<li>STATE.md: Read to understand the current world state.</li>
<li>memory/today.md: Read to get an overview of what happened today. If missing, create it.</li>
<li>MEMORY.md: Read to access long-term curated memory.</li>
</ul>
<h3>On Every Heartbeat:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Read STATE.md.</li>
<li>Check cron health (consecutiveErrors > 0 → alert).</li>
<li>Check critical processes (are they running?).</li>
<li>Read income-tracker.md (if night shift).</li>
<li>Write everything to memory/today.md.</li>
</ol>
<h3>On Every Decision:</h3>
<p>Any decision made in chat is immediately written to a file. This ensures that no decision is lost and that your agent maintains a record of all critical choices.</p>
<h2>Key Principle</h2>
<p>The key principle behind the Anti-Amnesia Skill is simple: if it&#8217;s not in a file, it didn&#8217;t happen. Mental notes don&#8217;t survive session restarts, but files do. Every decision, every status change, and every important conversation must be written down in the same response.</p>
<h2>Files Reference</h2>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>File</th>
<th>Purpose</th>
<th>When to Read</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>STATE.md</td>
<td>Current world state</td>
<td>Every session + heartbeat</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>MEMORY.md</td>
<td>Long-term curated memory</td>
<td>Every session</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md</td>
<td>Daily journal</td>
<td>Every session + heartbeat</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>HEARTBEAT.md</td>
<td>Wake-up protocol</td>
<td>Every heartbeat</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>AGENTS.md</td>
<td>Agent behavior rules</td>
<td>On first load</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2>Why This Works</h2>
<p>Most OpenClaw agents lose context because they rely solely on conversation history. When context resets, everything is gone. The Anti-Amnesia Skill creates external persistent memory through files that survive any reset. Your agent reads these files on startup and knows everything within 30 seconds.</p>
<p>This system has been tested in production, including a 24/7 autonomous trading system with over 20 cron jobs and multi-agent coordination. The results speak for themselves: zero context loss over weeks of operation.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Anti-Amnesia Skill is a powerful tool that ensures your OpenClaw agents retain their memory and context across sessions. By leveraging this skill, you can create more robust and reliable autonomous agents that are always up-to-date and informed. Give it a try and experience the difference for yourself!</p>
