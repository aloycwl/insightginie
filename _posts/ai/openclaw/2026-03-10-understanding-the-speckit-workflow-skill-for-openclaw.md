<h1>Understanding the SpecKit Workflow Skill for OpenClaw</h1>
<p>In the dynamic world of software development, maintaining an organized and efficient workflow is crucial. OpenClaw, an innovative platform, offers a range of skills to streamline various aspects of the development process. One such skill is the <strong>SpecKit Workflow</strong> skill, designed to orchestrate the complete <strong>Spec-Driven Development (SDD)</strong> lifecycle. In this blog post, we&#8217;ll delve into what this skill does, its components, and how it integrates with OpenClaw.</p>
<h2>Introduction to SpecKit Workflow</h2>
<p>The <strong>SpecKit Workflow</strong> skill is a master orchestrator for the <strong>SpecKit for OpenClaw</strong> engineering workflow. It is responsible for initializing <strong>SpecKit</strong> and managing the entire engineering lifecycle, from the initial setup to the final implementation phase. This skill ensures that all steps are followed in a precise and controlled manner, adhering to the <strong>Spec-Driven Development</strong> methodology.</p>
<h2>Security and Git Operations</h2>
<p>Before diving into the workflow, it&#8217;s essential to address security and git operations. The skill is designed to automate certain git operations, such as committing changes, pushing to the repository, and creating branches. However, these actions are contingent upon user consent.</p>
<h3>Agent Requirements</h3>
<p>Before starting the workflow or initializing a new project, the agent must ask the user for permission:</p>
<p><strong>Agent:</strong> &#8220;Do you want to enable automated <code>git commit</code>, <code>git push</code>, and <code>branch creation</code> for this project? (Yes/No)&#8221;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If Yes:</strong> The agent proceeds with automated commits, pushes, and branch creation, ensuring it has write access.</li>
<li><strong>If No:</strong> The agent refrains from performing any git operations and writes files locally. The user is responsible for version control.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step 1: Initialization</h2>
<p>The first step in the workflow is <strong>Initialization</strong>. This involves setting up the necessary directories and files for the SpecKit workflow.</p>
<h3>Initialization Instructions for the Agent</h3>
<p>The agent must follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Ask for Git Permission:</strong> As mentioned earlier, the agent must seek user consent for automated git operations.</li>
<li><strong>Check for <code>.specify/</code> Directory:</strong> The agent checks if the <code>.specify/</code> directory exists in the project root.</li>
<li><strong>Copy <code>.specify/</code> Directory:</strong> If the directory is missing, the agent copies it from the skill package (located at <code>./.specify/</code>) to the project root.</li>
<li><strong>Create Destination Directory:</strong> The agent creates the destination directory if it doesn&#8217;t exist.</li>
<li><strong>Confirm Successful Initialization:</strong> The agent verifies that the initialization process is complete.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Step 2: Workflow Orchestration</h2>
<p>Once the initialization is complete, the agent orchestrates the workflow according to the canonical <strong>Spec-kit order</strong>. This involves delegating tasks to specialized sub-agents for each phase of the development lifecycle.</p>
<h3>Execution Order</h3>
<p>The SpecKit Workflow follows a specific execution order for each phase, ensuring a systematic approach to development. The phases include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Constitution:</strong> Establish code quality, testing standards, and architectural constraints. Delegate to <code>speckit-constitution</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Specify:</strong> Transform requirements into a formal <code>spec.md</code>. Delegate to <code>speckit-specify</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Clarify (Optional):</strong> Address any ambiguities in the specification. Delegate to <code>speckit-clarify</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Plan:</strong> Derive technical design and implementation architecture. Delegate to <code>speckit-plan</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Tasks:</strong> Break the plan into actionable task lists. Delegate to <code>speckit-tasks</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Analyze (Optional):</strong> Ensure cross-artifact consistency. Delegate to <code>speckit-analyze</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Implement:</strong> Execute the implementation phase. Delegate to <code>speckit-implement</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Implementation Session Management</h2>
<p>During the <strong>Implementation</strong> phase, the agent must manage sessions effectively to ensure focused and efficient task completion. Here are the key steps:</p>
<h3>Isolate Context</h3>
<p>Trigger a new agent session for implementation to maintain focus.</p>
<h3>Dynamic Task Chunking</h3>
<p>Group tasks from <code>tasks.md</code> dynamically based on requirements and complexity.</p>
<ul>
<li>For small/simple tasks, group 3-5 tasks (e.g., T001 to T005).</li>
<li>For complex tasks, group 1-2 tasks.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sub-Agent Execution</h3>
<p>Delegate each task chunk to a sub-agent using <code>speckit-implement</code>.</p>
<h3>Commit &#038; Push</h3>
<p>After completing a task chunk, the sub-agent must commit and push the changes to the repository.</p>
<h3>Mark Completion</h3>
<p>The sub-agent ensures tasks are marked as complete in <code>tasks.md</code> before returning.</p>
<h3>Avoid Over-Grouping</h3>
<p>Do not group too many tasks in a single sub-agent session to maintain precision and manageable diffs.</p>
<h2>Resuming Workflow</h2>
<p>Before starting or resuming a project, the agent must determine the current state by checking for SpecKit artifacts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Check for Initialization:</strong> Verify the existence of the <code>.specify/</code> directory.</li>
<li><strong>Determine Current Phase:</strong> Identify the current phase based on the presence of specific files:
<ul>
<li><code>.specify/memory/constitution.md</code> (Constitution complete).</li>
<li><code>specs/<feature>/spec.md</code> (Specify complete).</li>
<li><code>specs/<feature>/plan.md</code> (Plan complete).</li>
<li><code>specs/<feature>/tasks.md</code> (Tasks complete).</li>
<li>Partially marked tasks in <code>tasks.md</code> (Implementation in progress).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Always resume from the first incomplete phase in the <strong>Execution Order</strong>.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The <strong>SpecKit Workflow</strong> skill is a powerful tool for managing the Spec-Driven Development lifecycle within OpenClaw. By following a structured approach, it ensures that each phase of development is executed efficiently and systematically. From initialization to implementation, this skill orchestrates the workflow, delegating tasks to specialized sub-agents, and managing sessions for optimal performance.</p>
<p>By understanding the nuances of this skill, developers can leverage its capabilities to enhance their workflow, improve code quality, and streamline their development process. Whether you&#8217;re a seasoned developer or just starting with OpenClaw, the SpecKit Workflow skill is an invaluable asset for achieving success in your projects.</p>
