<h1>Introduction to the OpenClaw Tides Skill</h1>
<p>In the modern era of data-driven development, the ability to access environmental data programmatically has become increasingly vital for applications ranging from marine research to recreational planning. The OpenClaw project has introduced a powerful toolset known as the Tides skill, designed to provide developers with seamless access to global ocean tide models. By leveraging the hamandmore API, this skill allows users to retrieve precise tide heights, extremas, and even grid weather data with just a few lines of code.</p>
<h2>What is the Tides Skill?</h2>
<p>The Tides skill is a functional component within the OpenClaw ecosystem that serves as a bridge to comprehensive harmonic tide models. Instead of forcing developers to build complex mathematical models for tide prediction from scratch, this skill provides a standardized JSON-RPC interface. This ensures that whether you are building a dashboard for coastal weather, a navigation tool for boaters, or a research utility, you have a reliable data source at your fingertips.</p>
<h2>Technical Architecture</h2>
<p>The Tides skill operates on a JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol, which is a lightweight, language-agnostic remote procedure call protocol. This choice makes the API highly interoperable, allowing it to be integrated into environments ranging from Python and JavaScript to Go and Rust. All requests are routed through a centralized endpoint at <code>https://hamandmore.net/api/harmonics/mcp</code>, utilizing standard POST requests to transmit instructions.</p>
<h3>Authentication Tiers</h3>
<p>OpenClaw offers a flexible approach to API usage through different authentication modes. By default, the service allows anonymous access under a free tier, which is subjected to standard rate limiting to ensure fairness for all users. For enterprise or high-volume applications, OpenClaw provides a keyed access system. Developers can request higher usage tiers by contacting the maintainers directly. When using a keyed approach, authentication is handled via standard HTTP headers using either the <code>Authorization: Bearer</code> or <code>Authorization: Basic</code> format, ensuring that your requests remain secure and authenticated.</p>
<h2>Core Functionalities</h2>
<p>The utility of the Tides skill is best demonstrated by its core functions, which cover the most common use cases for marine data:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tides Time (<code>tides_time</code>):</strong> Allows the user to query the current synchronized time of the system, ensuring that all subsequent tide calculations are aligned with the server&#8217;s reference clock.</li>
<li><strong>Tides Single (<code>tides_single</code>):</strong> This is the primary function for calculating the tide height at a specific latitude, longitude, and timestamp. It is perfect for real-time visualization of tide levels.</li>
<li><strong>Tides Extrema (<code>tides_extrema</code>):</strong> Essential for planning, this function returns the high and low tide markers within a specified date range.</li>
<li><strong>Weather Met (<code>weather_met</code>):</strong> Beyond simple tidal data, this skill allows access to grid weather data, such as surface wind speeds and temperatures, making it a comprehensive tool for environmental monitoring.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Getting Started: A Practical Guide</h2>
<p>Integrating the Tides skill is designed to be straightforward. The API follows a consistent JSON-RPC envelope, which requires an <code>id</code> for correlation, a <code>method</code> to define the operation, and a <code>params</code> object for the data input. To start, a developer should perform an <code>initialize</code> call to handshake with the service, followed by a <code>tools/list</code> call to verify which functions are available. Once confirmed, specific tools can be called using the <code>tools/call</code> method.</p>
<h3>Example: Querying Tide Extrema</h3>
<p>To calculate the highs and lows of a tide for a specific coordinate, such as New York City, you would construct a JSON payload with the <code>tides_extrema</code> method. Providing the <code>start_time</code> and <code>end_time</code> allows the API to return a formatted list of all tidal extremes occurring within that period. This information is returned in a structured format, making it incredibly easy to parse within your application&#8217;s logic, reducing the need for complex data transformation.</p>
<h2>Why Use the OpenClaw Tides Skill?</h2>
<p>The most compelling reason to utilize this skill is the abstraction of complexity. Predicting tides is a notoriously difficult task, often requiring massive datasets and high-performance computing to handle the harmonic constants required for accuracy. The Tides skill handles all of that heavy lifting on the server side. Developers only need to provide the location and the time window. Furthermore, because it is built within the OpenClaw ecosystem, it is designed to be highly extensible. Future updates to the API are handled server-side, meaning that your application will benefit from improved models or data sources without needing a complete refactor of your codebase.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The OpenClaw Tides skill is a stellar example of how open-source collaboration and well-designed APIs can simplify technical challenges. By providing a clean, consistent interface to complex oceanographic data, it empowers developers to build better maritime tools with less effort. Whether you are a hobbyist looking to track local tide shifts or a developer building a complex environmental monitoring platform, the integration guide and robust API provided by OpenClaw ensure that you have everything you need to succeed. We encourage you to sign up for the service, review the documentation, and start building your first tide-aware application today.</p>
