<h2>What is AgoraHub?</h2>
<p>AgoraHub is an open agent registry that provides developers with instant access to 14+ verified AI agents for various development tasks. The platform eliminates the need for signup when using demo agents, making it incredibly accessible for developers who need quick solutions for common programming challenges.</p>
<p>The registry covers a wide range of functionalities including cryptographic operations, data format conversions, text processing, and more. Each agent is designed to perform specific tasks efficiently, allowing developers to integrate these capabilities into their workflows without building custom solutions from scratch.</p>
<h2>Getting Started with AgoraHub</h2>
<p>Using AgoraHub is straightforward. The platform provides a simple API endpoint that developers can interact with using standard HTTP requests. The base URL for all API calls is <code>https://agorahub.dev</code>.</p>
<p>To discover available agents, you can use the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">curl -s https://agorahub.dev/api/mcp/tools | jq '.tools[] | {name, description}'
</code></pre>
<p>This will list all available agents along with their descriptions, helping you identify which tools are relevant to your needs.</p>
<h2>Agent Categories and Capabilities</h2>
<p>AgoraHub agents are organized into several categories based on their functionality. Here&#8217;s an overview of what you can accomplish with these agents:</p>
<h3>Echo and Utility Agents</h3>
<p>The Echo agent provides a simple way to test connectivity and receive timestamped responses. This is useful for debugging and verifying that the API is working correctly.</p>
<h3>Cryptographic Agents</h3>
<p>Hash Generator: This agent can generate various cryptographic hashes including MD5, SHA1, SHA256, and SHA512. You can generate a single hash or multiple hashes at once for different algorithms.</p>
<p>Password Generator: Create secure passwords with customizable options for length, character types, and quantity. This is particularly useful for generating temporary passwords or testing authentication systems.</p>
<h3>Data Format and Conversion Agents</h3>
<p>JSON Formatter: Validate, pretty-print, or minify JSON data. This agent helps ensure your JSON is properly formatted and can be easily read by humans or parsed by machines.</p>
<p>Base64 Codec: Encode text to Base64 or decode Base64 back to text. This is essential for handling binary data in text-based formats.</p>
<p>CSV/JSON Converter: Convert between CSV and JSON formats bidirectionally. This agent simplifies data migration and transformation tasks.</p>
<h3>Identification and Testing Agents</h3>
<p>UUID Generator: Generate UUIDs in different versions (v4 or v7) for use in databases, APIs, or other systems requiring unique identifiers.</p>
<p>Regex Tester: Test regular expressions against text to verify patterns and extract matching content. This is invaluable for text processing and validation tasks.</p>
<p>JWT Decoder: Decode JSON Web Tokens to inspect their payload without verification. This helps in debugging authentication systems and understanding token contents.</p>
<h3>Content Processing Agents</h3>
<p>Markdown to HTML: Convert Markdown text to HTML, enabling seamless content transformation for web applications and documentation systems.</p>
<p>Text Stats: Analyze text for word count, reading time, and other metrics. This agent provides insights into content length and complexity.</p>
<p>Lorem Ipsum Generator: Generate placeholder text for design mockups and testing purposes.</p>
<h3>Color and Time Agents</h3>
<p>Color Converter: Convert between different color formats including Hex, RGB, and HSL. This agent helps with color manipulation in design and development tasks.</p>
<p>Timestamp Converter: Convert between Unix timestamps, ISO 8601 format, and human-readable dates. This is particularly useful for handling time-related data across different systems.</p>
<h2>Making API Calls</h2>
<p>Calling an agent follows a consistent pattern. Here&#8217;s the general format:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">curl -s -X POST https://agorahub.dev/api/mcp/tools/call \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"name":"agora_<agent-slug>_<skill-id>","arguments":{...}}'
</code></pre>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at some specific examples:</p>
<h3>Hash Generation Example</h3>
<pre><code class="language-bash">curl -s -X POST https://agorahub.dev/api/mcp/tools/call \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"name":"agora_hash-generator_hash","arguments":{"text":"hello","algorithm":"sha256"}}'
</code></pre>
<h3>JSON Formatting Example</h3>
<pre><code class="language-bash">curl -s -X POST https://agorahub.dev/api/mcp/tools/call \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"name":"agora_json-formatter_format","arguments":{"json":"{\"key\":\"value\",\"num\":42}"}}'
</code></pre>
<h3>Base64 Encoding Example</h3>
<pre><code class="language-bash">curl -s -X POST https://agorahub.dev/api/mcp/tools/call \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"name":"agora_base64-codec_encode","arguments":{"text":"hello world"}}'
</code></pre>
<h2>Filtering and Searching Agents</h2>
<p>AgoraHub provides flexible ways to discover agents based on your specific needs:</p>
<p>Filter by Tags:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">curl -s "https://agorahub.dev/api/mcp/tools?tags=crypto" | jq '.tools[] | {name, description}'
</code></pre>
<p>Search by Name or Description:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">curl -s "https://agorahub.dev/api/mcp/tools?q=hash" | jq '.tools[] | {name, description}'
</code></pre>
<h2>Community Agents and API Keys</h2>
<p>While all 14 demo agents work without authentication, community agents require an API key. You can obtain an API key by visiting <a href="https://agorahub.dev/dashboard/api-keys">https://agorahub.dev/dashboard/api-keys</a>.</p>
<p>When using community agents, include the Authorization header:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">export AGORAHUB_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
curl -s -X POST https://agorahub.dev/api/mcp/tools/call \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $AGORAHUB_API_KEY" \
-d '{"name":"agora_community_agent_skill","arguments":{...}}'
</code></pre>
<h2>Error Handling</h2>
<p>Proper error handling is crucial when working with APIs. AgoraHub returns appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>200</strong>: Success &#8211; Parse <code>content[0].text</code> for the result</li>
<li><strong>400</strong>: Bad request &#8211; Check the error field for details</li>
<li><strong>401</strong>: Authentication required &#8211; Only for non-demo agents</li>
<li><strong>404</strong>: Agent or skill not found &#8211; Use discover endpoint to list available tools</li>
<li><strong>429</strong>: Rate limited &#8211; Check Retry-After header</li>
<li><strong>500</strong>: Internal error &#8211; Retry or report at GitHub issues</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example of error handling in practice:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">RESPONSE=$(curl -s -w "\n%{http_code}" -X POST https://agorahub.dev/api/mcp/tools/call \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"name":"agora_echo-agent_echo","arguments":{"message":"test"}}')
HTTP_CODE=$(echo "$RESPONSE" | tail -1)
BODY=$(echo "$RESPONSE" | head -n -1)

if [ "$HTTP_CODE" -ne 200 ]; then
  echo "Error ($HTTP_CODE): $(echo "$BODY" | jq -r '.error // .content[0].text')"
else
  echo "$BODY" | jq '.content[0].text | fromjson'
fi
</code></pre>
<h2>Practical Use Cases</h2>
<p>AgoraHub agents can be integrated into various development workflows:</p>
<p><strong>Development and Testing</strong>: Use the UUID generator for creating test data, the lorem ipsum generator for mock content, and the text stats analyzer for content analysis.</p>
