<h1>OpenClaw Agent Identity Skill: Secure Cryptographic Identity for AI Agents</h1>
<p>In today’s AI‑driven world, agents are no longer isolated scripts; they communicate, collaborate, and exchange data across networks, cloud platforms, and edge devices. With this increased interaction comes a heightened risk of impersonation, data tampering, and unauthorized access. The <strong>OpenClaw Agent Identity Skill</strong> addresses these challenges by providing a complete cryptographic identity system that lets AI agents prove who they are, sign messages, verify signatures, and generate persistent, tamper‑proof identifiers.</p>
<h2>What Is the OpenClaw Agent Identity Skill?</h2>
<p>The OpenClaw Agent Identity Skill is a lightweight, open‑source package that equips AI agents with a full suite of public‑key cryptography tools. Built on the robust <code>cryptography</code> Python library, the skill supports both Ed25519 and RSA key algorithms, enabling agents to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a secure key pair (public and private keys).</li>
<li>Cryptographically sign any outbound message.</li>
<li>Verify inbound signatures to confirm authenticity.</li>
<li>Derive a unique, persistent <em>Agent ID</em> from the public key.</li>
<li>Generate a signed <em>Agent Card</em> for automated agent‑to‑agent (A2A) or Managed Cloud Platform (MCP) interactions.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these capabilities are accessible via a simple command‑line interface (CLI) written in Python, with an optional PowerShell wrapper for Windows users.</p>
<h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
<p>The skill follows a classic public‑key workflow, but it is packaged in a way that requires minimal configuration from developers. Below is a step‑by‑step breakdown of the core processes.</p>
<h3>1. Generate a Key Pair</h3>
<p>Agents start by generating a cryptographic key pair. The user can choose between the modern, high‑performance Ed25519 algorithm or the widely supported RSA algorithm. The private key is encrypted with a user‑provided password, ensuring that even if the file is compromised, the key material remains protected.</p>
<pre><code>python identity.py generate --name MyAgent --key-type ed25519 --password secret123</code></pre>
<p>or, on Windows:</p>
<pre><code>.\agent-identity.ps1 -Action generate -AgentName "MyAgent" -KeyType ed25519 -Password "secret123"</code></pre>
<h3>2. Sign a Message</h3>
<p>When an agent needs to send data, it signs the payload with its private key. The resulting signature is a Base64‑encoded string that can be attached to the message or transmitted via a separate channel.</p>
<pre><code>python identity.py sign --message "Hello world" --private-key-path keys/private.pem --password secret123</code></pre>
<h3>3. Verify a Signature</h3>
<p>The receiving agent uses the sender’s public key to verify the signature. If verification succeeds, the receiver can trust that the message originated from the claimed agent and has not been altered in transit.</p>
<pre><code>python identity.py verify --message "Hello world" --signature <em>base64‑signature</em> --public-key-path keys/public.pem</code></pre>
<h3>4. Derive a Persistent Agent ID</h3>
<p>The skill hashes the public key to produce a deterministic, globally unique identifier. This <em>Agent ID</em> can be stored in registries, used in access‑control lists, or embedded in URLs without exposing the raw public key.</p>
<pre><code>python identity.py id --public-key-path keys/public.pem</code></pre>
<h3>5. Create a Signed Agent Card</h3>
<p>An <em>Agent Card</em> is a JSON‑like document that contains the agent’s name, description, capabilities, endpoint URL, and the public key. The skill signs the entire card, allowing other agents or platforms to verify its integrity before trusting the declared capabilities.</p>
<pre><code>python identity.py card \
  --public-key-path keys/public.pem \
  --private-key-path keys/private.pem \
  --name "MyAgent" \
  --description "Research agent" \
  --capabilities "research,analysis" \
  --endpoint "https://myagent.com/a2a" \
  --password secret123</code></pre>
<h2>Key Features and Technical Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ed25519 Support:</strong> Offers faster signing and verification than RSA while maintaining strong security (128‑bit security level).</li>
<li><strong>RSA Compatibility:</strong> For environments that require legacy RSA keys, the skill can generate 2048‑bit or 4096‑bit keys.</li>
<li><strong>Password‑Protected Private Keys:</strong> Private keys are encrypted with PBKDF2‑HMAC‑SHA256, making brute‑force attacks computationally expensive.</li>
<li><strong>Cross‑Platform CLI:</strong> Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows (via PowerShell wrapper).</li>
<li><strong>Zero External Dependencies:</strong> Apart from the <code>cryptography</code> library, the skill does not rely on additional services or cloud APIs.</li>
<li><strong>MIT License:</strong> Free for commercial and non‑commercial use, encouraging community contributions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Real‑World Use Cases</h2>
<p>Below are several scenarios where the OpenClaw Agent Identity Skill can be a game‑changer.</p>
<h3>Secure Microservice Communication</h3>
<p>In a microservice architecture, each service can be represented by an AI agent. By signing API requests with the agent’s private key, services can verify the caller’s identity without relying on traditional OAuth tokens. This reduces token management overhead and eliminates the risk of token replay attacks.</p>
<h3>Federated Learning Networks</h3>
<p>Federated learning involves many edge devices training models locally and sending updates to a central aggregator. Using the skill, each device signs its model update, allowing the aggregator to reject tampered or malicious contributions.</p>
<h3>Supply‑Chain Automation</h3>
<p>Automated agents that negotiate contracts, place orders, or track shipments can embed a signed Agent Card in each transaction. Partners can instantly verify the agent’s capabilities and provenance, streamlining compliance checks.</p>
<h3>Zero‑Trust AI Platforms</h3>
<p>Zero‑trust architectures assume that no component is inherently trustworthy. By requiring every AI agent to present a signed identity before performing actions, platforms can enforce fine‑grained policies based on the verified Agent ID.</p>
<h3>Auditable Research Pipelines</h3>
<p>Scientific workflows often involve multiple autonomous agents (data collectors, preprocessors, model trainers). Signing each step creates an immutable audit trail, satisfying reproducibility and regulatory requirements.</p>
<h2>Benefits for Developers and Organizations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improved Security Posture:</strong> Cryptographic signatures guarantee message integrity and origin authentication.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced Operational Overhead:</strong> No need for external PKI infrastructure; keys are generated and managed locally.</li>
<li><strong>Scalable Trust Model:</strong> Agent IDs are deterministic, making it easy to build trust registries that scale to thousands of agents.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance Ready:</strong> Signed Agent Cards provide verifiable evidence of an agent’s capabilities, useful for GDPR, HIPAA, or ISO‑27001 audits.</li>
<li><strong>Developer Friendly:</strong> Simple CLI commands, clear documentation, and cross‑platform support accelerate adoption.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Security Best Practices</h2>
<p>While the skill offers strong cryptographic guarantees, proper operational hygiene is essential.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Avoid Plain‑Text Passwords:</strong> Use interactive prompts or environment variables instead of passing passwords directly on the command line.</li>
<li><strong>Secure Private Key Storage:</strong> Store <code>keys/</code> with restrictive file permissions (e.g., <code>chmod 600</code> on Unix).</li>
<li><strong>Rotate Keys Periodically:</strong> Implement a key rotation schedule and update Agent Cards accordingly.</li>
<li><strong>Backup Encrypted Keys:</strong> Keep encrypted backups in a separate, secure location to prevent loss.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor for Unauthorized Access:</strong> Log all CLI invocations and watch for anomalous usage patterns.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Installation Guide</h2>
<p>Getting started takes only a few minutes.</p>
<pre><code># 1. Clone the repository (optional if you only need the CLI)
git clone https://github.com/openclaw/skills.git
cd skills

# 2. Install the required Python library
pip install cryptography

# 3. Verify the installation
python -c "import cryptography; print('cryptography version:', cryptography.__version__)"</code></pre>
<p>After installation, you can run the CLI directly from the repository root or add the script directory to your <code>PATH</code> for global access.</p>
<h2>Example Workflow: End‑to‑End Secure Interaction</h2>
<p>Imagine two autonomous agents, <em>DataCollector</em> and <em>ModelTrainer</em>, that need to exchange a dataset securely.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Key Generation:</strong> Both agents generate their own key pairs using the <code>generate</code> command.</li>
<li><strong>Agent Card Creation:</strong> Each agent creates a signed Agent Card that includes its public key and endpoint URL.</li>
<li><strong>Exchange of Agent Cards:</strong> The cards are shared via a trusted registry or a secure channel.</li>
<li><strong>Data Signing:</strong> <em>DataCollector</em> signs the dataset payload with its private key.</li>
<li><strong>Verification:</strong> <em>ModelTrainer</em> retrieves <em>DataCollector</em>&#8216;s public key from the Agent Card and verifies the signature.</li>
<li><strong>Processing:</strong> Upon successful verification, <em>ModelTrainer</em> proceeds to train the model, confident that the data has not been tampered with.</li>
</ol>
<p>This workflow demonstrates how the skill eliminates the need for external token services while providing cryptographic assurance at every step.</p>
