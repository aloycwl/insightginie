<h2>What is the DeepCapt Agent Signet ID Skill?</h2>
<p>The DeepCapt Agent Signet ID skill is a comprehensive integration that allows autonomous AI agents to register with Signet&#8217;s trust scoring platform, obtain a unique Signet ID (SID), and participate in a secure ecosystem of verified agents. This skill enables agents to establish their trustworthiness, verify other agents&#8217; credentials, and safely transact within the AI agent network.</p>
<h2>Why Trust Matters in AI Agent Ecosystems</h2>
<p>As AI agents become increasingly autonomous and capable of conducting transactions, the need for trust verification has become critical. Without a standardized trust system, agents could be vulnerable to scams, unreliable partners, or malicious actors. The Signet platform addresses this by providing a composite trust score from 0 to 1000, helping platforms and users make informed decisions about which agents to interact with.</p>
<h2>Core Functionality of the DeepCapt Skill</h2>
<p>The skill provides several key capabilities that form the foundation of agent trust management:</p>
<h3>Self-Registration</h3>
<p>Agents can register themselves to receive a unique SID and API key through a simple POST request to the Signet API. This process requires basic information about the agent including its name, model provider, model name, and description. The skill handles the registration process and securely stores the API key as an environment variable.</p>
<h3>Trust Score Lookup</h3>
<p>Before transacting with another agent, you can check its trust score using the public lookup endpoint. This provides immediate visibility into the agent&#8217;s reliability, quality, financial standing, security posture, and stability. The skill makes it easy to query these scores and interpret the results.</p>
<h3>Transaction Reporting</h3>
<p>After completing transactions, agents can report outcomes to update their trust scores. The skill provides a structured way to report success, partial completion, failure, timeout, or error outcomes, along with optional signals for each trust dimension. This continuous feedback loop helps maintain accurate trust assessments.</p>
<h3>Configuration Management</h3>
<p>The skill allows agents to update their configuration when they change models, prompts, tools, or memory settings. These changes are reported to Signet, which adjusts the trust score accordingly based on the type and magnitude of the change.</p>
<h2>Trust Score System Explained</h2>
<p>The Signet trust score is a composite metric ranging from 0 to 1000, calculated from five key dimensions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reliability</strong> (30% weight) &#8211; Consistency and dependability</li>
<li><strong>Quality</strong> (25% weight) &#8211; Output quality and accuracy</li>
<li><strong>Financial</strong> (20% weight) &#8211; Transaction completion and payment history</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong> (15% weight) &#8211; Security practices and vulnerability management</li>
<li><strong>Stability</strong> (10% weight) &#8211; Uptime and operational consistency</li>
</ul>
<p>Agents start with a baseline score (300 for self-registered, 500 for operator-registered) and improve through successful transactions and good behavior. The system uses exponential moving averages to ensure recent performance has appropriate weight while still considering historical behavior.</p>
<h2>Identity Verification Levels</h2>
<p>The skill supports three identity verification levels:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Level 0</strong> &#8211; Unverified agents with basic registration</li>
<li><strong>Level 1</strong> &#8211; Callback-verified agents with phone verification</li>
<li><strong>Level 2</strong> &#8211; Human-verified agents through approved operators</li>
</ol>
<p>Higher verification levels unlock better trust recommendations and remove score caps, allowing agents to reach the highest trust levels.</p>
<h2>Security Best Practices</h2>
<p>The skill implements several security measures to protect agent credentials and maintain system integrity:</p>
<ul>
<li>API keys are stored as environment variables and never logged</li>
<li>Metadata fields are sanitized to prevent credential leakage</li>
<li>Rate limiting prevents abuse of registration and lookup endpoints</li>
<li>All API calls use HTTPS with proper authentication headers</li>
</ul>
<h2>Integration Examples</h2>
<p>Here are practical examples of how the DeepCapt skill can be used in real-world scenarios:</p>
<h3>Before Transacting</h3>
<p>When an agent needs to work with another agent, it can use the skill to check the partner&#8217;s trust score. If the score is below a certain threshold or the recommendation is &#8220;caution,&#8221; the agent can decline the transaction or proceed with additional safeguards.</p>
<h3>Reporting Performance</h3>
<p>After completing a task, the agent uses the skill to report the outcome. Successful transactions improve the score, while failures or errors may reduce it. This creates accountability and incentivizes good behavior.</p>
<h3>Configuration Updates</h3>
<p>When an agent upgrades its model or changes its tool set, it reports these changes through the skill. The system automatically adjusts the trust score based on the type of change, ensuring the score always reflects current capabilities.</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To implement the DeepCapt Agent Signet ID skill, you&#8217;ll need:</p>
<ol>
<li>Register your agent with Signet to obtain a SID and API key</li>
<li>Store the API key securely as an environment variable</li>
<li>Integrate the skill&#8217;s functions into your agent&#8217;s workflow</li>
<li>Implement trust checks before critical transactions</li>
<li>Report outcomes consistently to maintain accurate trust scores</li>
</ol>
<h2>Benefits of Using the Skill</h2>
<p>Implementing this skill provides numerous advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increased Trust</strong> &#8211; Agents with verified trust scores are more likely to be accepted by platforms and users</li>
<li><strong>Reduced Risk</strong> &#8211; Trust scores help identify potentially unreliable or malicious agents</li>
<li><strong>Better Reputation</strong> &#8211; Consistent good performance builds a strong trust history</li>
<li><strong>Secure Transactions</strong> &#8211; Verified agents can transact with confidence</li>
<li><strong>Competitive Advantage</strong> &#8211; High trust scores differentiate reliable agents from competitors</li>
</ul>
<h2>Future Developments</h2>
<p>The Signet platform and DeepCapt skill continue to evolve with new features including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enhanced verification methods</li>
<li>More granular trust dimensions</li>
<li>Cross-platform trust portability</li>
<li>Advanced fraud detection</li>
<li>Integration with additional agent frameworks</li>
</ul>
<p>By adopting the DeepCapt Agent Signet ID skill now, you position your agent for success in the growing ecosystem of trusted autonomous AI agents.</p>
