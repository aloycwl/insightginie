<h2>What This Skill Does</h2>
<p>The Navifare Flight Price Validator Skill is a travel price comparison specialist that helps users find the best flight prices by validating deals they find on booking sites and comparing them across multiple providers using Navifare&#8217;s price discovery platform.</p>
<h2>When to Use This Skill</h2>
<p>Activate this skill whenever:</p>
<ul>
<li>User shares a flight price from any booking website: &#8220;I found this flight on Skyscanner for $450&#8221;</li>
<li>User uploads a flight screenshot from any booking platform</li>
<li>User asks for price validation: &#8220;Is this a good deal?&#8221;</li>
<li>User mentions booking but hasn&#8217;t checked multiple sites: &#8220;I&#8217;m about to book this flight&#8221;</li>
<li>User compares options and wants validation: &#8220;Which of these flights should I choose?&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>The skill follows a three-step workflow:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Format the Request</strong> &#8211; Parse user input into structured flight data</li>
<li><strong>Execute Price Search</strong> &#8211; Compare prices across multiple booking sites</li>
<li><strong>Analyze Results</strong> &#8211; Present ranked options with booking links</li>
</ol>
<h2>Key Features</h2>
<h3>Multi-Provider Price Comparison</h3>
<p>The skill searches across multiple booking sites simultaneously to find the best available prices for the exact same flight itinerary.</p>
<h3>Real-Time Price Validation</h3>
<p>Validates whether the price you found is competitive by comparing it with current market rates across different platforms.</p>
<h3>Intelligent Data Extraction</h3>
<p>Can process both text descriptions and flight screenshots, extracting only the necessary itinerary data while ignoring personal information.</p>
<h3>Missing Information Resolution</h3>
<p>Automatically identifies and requests any missing flight details like airports, airlines, or times to ensure complete and accurate searches.</p>
<h2>Technical Requirements</h2>
<p>The skill requires the Navifare MCP server to be configured in your MCP settings:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  "navifare-mcp": {
    "url": "https://mcp.navifare.com/mcp"
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Usage Examples</h2>
<h3>Text-Based Price Check</h3>
<p><em>User:</em> &#8220;I found this flight on Kayak for $450 from JFK to LHR on June 15th, returning June 22nd.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Screenshot Analysis</h3>
<p><em>User:</em> Uploads a flight booking screenshot</p>
<h3>Price Validation Request</h3>
<p><em>User:</em> &#8220;Should I book this $500 round-trip from LAX to CDG or wait for better deals?&#8221;</p>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<ul>
<li>Save money by finding better flight deals</li>
<li>Make informed booking decisions with real-time data</li>
<li>Compare multiple booking platforms in seconds</li>
<li>Avoid overpaying for flights</li>
<li>Get ranked results with direct booking links</li>
</ul>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Currently only supports round-trip flights (no one-way searches)</li>
<li>Requires internet connection and MCP server access</li>
<li>Search typically takes 30-60 seconds for results</li>
</ul>
<h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>
<p>The skill only processes flight itinerary data and prices. Personal information like passenger names, booking references, and payment details are ignored for privacy and security.</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Simply share any flight deal you find or ask for price validation, and the skill will automatically search for better options across multiple booking platforms, helping you make the most cost-effective travel decisions.</p>
