<h2>What Is AI Email Service?</h2>
<p>AI Email Service is a specialized email solution designed specifically for AI agents and automated systems. Unlike traditional email providers, this service offers receive-only email addresses that allow AI agents to sign up for services, receive verification codes, get password reset links, and read incoming emails without any sending capabilities.</p>
<p>The service is built on the principle of simplicity and security for AI agents, providing a straightforward API that enables automated systems to handle email-based workflows without human intervention. Whether you need to verify accounts, extract OTP codes, or monitor incoming messages, AI Email Service provides the infrastructure to make it happen.</p>
<h2>Why Receive-Only Email Matters for AI Agents</h2>
<p>Many AI applications require email addresses for various purposes, but traditional email accounts come with unnecessary complexity and security risks. AI Email Service solves this by providing receive-only addresses that eliminate the possibility of sending emails while maintaining all the benefits of having an inbox.</p>
<p>This approach is particularly valuable for automated systems that need to interact with services requiring email verification but shouldn&#8217;t have the ability to send messages. It&#8217;s perfect for testing environments, automated account creation, and any scenario where you need to receive emails but want to maintain strict control over outgoing communications.</p>
<h2>Core Features and Capabilities</h2>
<p>The service offers several key features that make it ideal for AI agent workflows:</p>
<p><strong>Free Mailbox Creation</strong>: Users can create up to five mailboxes per API key at no cost, making it accessible for developers and businesses of all sizes.</p>
<p><strong>Automatic OTP Extraction</strong>: The service automatically extracts verification codes, one-time passwords, and confirmation links from incoming emails, eliminating the need for manual parsing.</p>
<p><strong>Long-Polling Support</strong>: Instead of constantly polling for new messages, the service offers a wait endpoint that holds the connection until a matching email arrives or a timeout occurs.</p>
<p><strong>Structured JSON API</strong>: All interactions happen through a clean, RESTful API that returns structured JSON data, making it easy to integrate into any application.</p>
<h2>Getting Started: The Quick Start Guide</h2>
<p>Setting up AI Email Service is straightforward and requires just a few simple steps. First, you need to create an API key by making a POST request to the /v1/api-key/create endpoint. This key serves as your authentication credential for all subsequent requests.</p>
<p>Once you have your API key, you can create mailboxes by sending a POST request to /v1/mailbox/create. Each mailbox comes with a unique email address in the format of agent-name@aiemailservice.com. You can either let the system generate a random username or request a specific one.</p>
<p>After creating your mailbox, you can use the email address to sign up for any service that requires email verification. The service will automatically capture incoming emails and make them available through the API.</p>
<h2>API Endpoints and Authentication</h2>
<p>All API requests require authentication using the x-api-key header, except for the initial API key creation. The service provides several endpoints to handle different aspects of email management:</p>
<p>The /v1/mailbox/{id}/messages endpoint allows you to retrieve a list of all messages in a mailbox, with options to filter by date and limit the number of results. For detailed message content, you can use the /v1/mailbox/{id}/messages/{msgId} endpoint to get the full text and HTML content of individual messages.</p>
<p>The /v1/mailbox/{id}/wait endpoint is particularly useful for automated workflows, as it implements long-polling to wait for specific emails from certain senders or containing specific subjects. This eliminates the need for constant polling and reduces API usage.</p>
<p>For verification code extraction, the /v1/mailbox/{id}/codes endpoint automatically parses incoming emails and extracts OTP codes, verification codes, and confirmation links, making it easy to automate verification processes.</p>
<h2>Practical Use Cases</h2>
<p>AI Email Service is ideal for numerous scenarios where automated email handling is required. One common use case is automated account creation and verification, where an AI agent needs to sign up for multiple services and handle the verification process without human intervention.</p>
<p>Another valuable application is in testing environments, where developers need to simulate email-based workflows without setting up complex email infrastructure. The service can also be used for monitoring specific email addresses for incoming notifications or alerts.</p>
<p>For businesses that need to handle customer inquiries through automated systems, AI Email Service provides a way to receive emails and route them appropriately without giving the AI agent the ability to send responses.</p>
<h2>Security and Privacy Considerations</h2>
<p>The receive-only nature of the service provides inherent security benefits, as there&#8217;s no risk of unauthorized emails being sent from the addresses. All communications are encrypted in transit, and the service implements rate limiting to prevent abuse.</p>
<p>Messages are retained for 30 days, after which they are automatically deleted. Each mailbox can receive up to 100 inbound emails per day, which is sufficient for most automated workflows while preventing spam or abuse.</p>
<p>Users should be aware that while the service is free for basic usage, custom usernames can be reserved for a yearly fee. This allows businesses to maintain branded email addresses for their AI agents.</p>
<h2>Integration Examples</h2>
<p>Integrating AI Email Service into your application is straightforward with the provided API. Here&#8217;s a typical workflow: First, create an API key using the /v1/api-key/create endpoint. Then, create a mailbox and use the generated email address to sign up for the desired service.</p>
<p>Once the service sends a verification email, use the /v1/mailbox/{id}/wait endpoint to wait for the specific email. When it arrives, use the /v1/mailbox/{id}/codes endpoint to extract the verification code automatically. This entire process can be automated without any human intervention.</p>
<p>The service also provides a structured JSON prompt for AI agents, making it easy to integrate with AI-powered applications that need to handle email-based workflows.</p>
<h2>Limitations and Best Practices</h2>
<p>While AI Email Service is powerful, it does have some limitations. The receive-only nature means it cannot be used for scenarios requiring email sending capabilities. Additionally, the 5 mailbox limit per API key and 100 emails per day per mailbox may not be sufficient for high-volume applications.</p>
<p>Best practices include using the /wait endpoint instead of polling for new messages, as this is more efficient and reduces API usage. For OTP extraction, always prefer the /codes endpoint over manual parsing, as it&#8217;s more reliable and handles various email formats automatically.</p>
<p>When implementing automated workflows, consider implementing error handling for cases where emails don&#8217;t arrive within the expected timeframe or when the service is temporarily unavailable.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>AI Email Service represents a significant advancement in email automation for AI agents and automated systems. By providing receive-only email addresses with powerful API capabilities, it solves many common challenges in automated email handling while maintaining security and simplicity.</p>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re building automated testing systems, AI-powered customer service applications, or any other system that needs to handle email verification and notifications, AI Email Service offers a reliable, cost-effective solution that can be integrated quickly and easily into your existing workflows.</p>
<p>The combination of free basic usage, automatic OTP extraction, long-polling support, and a clean API makes it an excellent choice for developers and businesses looking to automate email-based processes without the complexity of traditional email infrastructure.</p>
