<p>The OpenClaw ecosystem continues to expand the capabilities of autonomous AI agents, and one of its most sophisticated contributions is the <strong>roundtable‑adaptive</strong> skill. Hosted in the <code>skills/skills/jimmyclanker/roundtable-adaptive/SKILL.md</code> file on GitHub, this skill transforms a simple prompt into a collaborative, multi‑model reasoning session that mimics a human roundtable discussion. Below we break down what the skill does, how it works under the hood, and why it matters for developers and researchers seeking higher‑quality AI output.</p>
<p>At its core, the roundtable‑adaptive skill is an orchestrator that launches up to four AI agents—referred to as panelists—to engage in a structured debate. The orchestrator itself never argues a position; its sole responsibility is to coordinate the panel, manage workflow design, and ensure that the final synthesis reflects a consensus derived from cross‑critique and formal scoring. The skill is configurable, allowing users to specify which models participate, how many debate rounds occur, and whether additional validation steps are added.</p>
<p>One of the defining features of this skill is its reliance on a <strong>meta‑panel</strong>. Before any debate begins, the orchestrator spawns four premium meta‑analysts (by default drawn from the <code>panels.json</code> configuration under <code>meta.models</code>). These agents receive the user’s prompt together with a brief web‑search grounding block and are tasked with designing the optimal workflow for the task at hand. The meta‑panel can recommend one of three high‑level structures: a pure parallel debate, a sequential pipeline, or a hybrid approach. The orchestrator then synthesizes the four recommendations, opting for a majority vote; in case of a tie, it prefers the hybrid model because of its flexibility.</p>
<p>The workflow design phase is skipped only when the user explicitly supplies a custom panel via the <code>--panel</code> flag or activates the <code>--quick</code> mode, which reduces the process to a single debate round and bypasses the meta‑panel altogether. This makes the skill adaptable to both exploratory, deep‑dives and rapid, low‑cost queries.</p>
<p>Before any agent sees the prompt, the skill performs a <strong>web search grounding</strong> step. A search query is issued to retrieve up to five recent results, which are then summarized into a <code>CURRENT_CONTEXT</code> block of no more than 250 words. This block contains key facts, recent developments, relevant data points, and the date of the search. If the search fails or times out, the skill continues with a note indicating that no real‑time data is available, allowing the discussion to proceed purely on model knowledge. The <code>CURRENT_CONTEXT</code> block is injected into the meta‑panel prompts and into every Round 1 agent prompt, ensuring that all participants argue from the same updated baseline.</p>
<p>Once the workflow is established, the orchestrator creates the actual debate panel. Depending on the chosen mode—<code>--debate</code>, <code>--build</code>, <code>--redteam</code>, <code>--vote</code>, or the auto‑detected default—the skill selects appropriate agents. Panelists are launched as persistent thread sessions (<code>mode="session"</code>, <code>thread=true</code>) so they can stay alive in a Discord thread for follow‑up questions. In contrast, the meta‑panel analysts and the final synthesis agent are one‑shot (<code>mode="run"</code>) entities that complete their task and terminate.</p>
<p>The debate itself proceeds in up to two rounds. In each round, each panelist receives the prompt, the <code>CURRENT_CONTEXT</code> block, and a summary of the previous round’s arguments (if applicable). They are instructed to critique each other&#8217;s positions, propose improvements, and score contributions based on criteria such as relevance, novelty, and logical soundness. After the final round, a synthesis agent aggregates the panelists’ outputs, applies the formal consensus scoring mechanism, and produces a final answer that is posted to the configured output channel.</p>
<p>Output routing is flexible. Users can define a dedicated output channel in <code>panels.json</code> under the <code>output</code> object, specifying a Discord channel ID and optionally enabling thread creation (<code>useThreads: true</code>). If no output channel is set, the results are posted back to the channel where the <code>roundtable</code> command was invoked. Additionally, the skill supports auto‑triggering: administrators can designate a Discord‑only roundtable channel in <code>AGENTS.md</code>, causing any message in that channel to be automatically treated as a roundtable topic without needing the explicit command prefix.</p>
<p>The skill includes a rich set of trigger patterns to fine‑tune behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>roundtable [prompt]</code> – auto‑detects mode, runs full flow.</li>
<li><code>roundtable --debate [prompt]</code> – forces parallel debate mode.</li>
<li><code>roundtable --build [prompt]</code> – forces a build/coding‑oriented workflow.</li>
<li><code>roundtable --redteam [prompt]</code> – activates adversarial red‑team analysis.</li>
<li><code>roundtable --vote [prompt]</code> – forces a decision‑making/vote workflow.</li>
<li><code>roundtable --quick [prompt]</code> – skips meta‑panel, uses default panel for a single round (half cost).</li>
<li><code>roundtable --panel model1,model2,model3 [prompt]</code> – manual panel override, bypasses meta‑panel.</li>
<li><code>roundtable --validate [prompt]</code> – adds a third‑round validation agent that reviews the synthesis.</li>
<li><code>roundtable --no-search [prompt]</code> – omits the web‑search grounding step for purely theoretical topics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cost transparency is another hallmark of the skill. The core Claude Opus panelist is free when using OAuth or an API key. Adding the optional GPT‑5.3 Codex panelist remains free via OAuth. The Grok 4 and Gemini 3.1 Pro models are accessed through the Blockrun proxy, incurring modest fees—approximately $0.05 for Gemini and $0.08 for Grok per full run. A full panel therefore costs roughly $0.13–$0.50 per execution, while a Claude‑only degraded mode remains entirely free. The <code>--quick</code> flag halves the cost by limiting the process to a single debate round.</p>
<p>Setup is straightforward. For a minimal, free‑tier deployment, users need only configure the Anthropic provider in <code>openclaw.json</code> (either via API key or OAuth). Optionally, adding the OpenAI provider enables the GPT‑5.3 Codex slot. To unlock the full panel with Grok and Gemini, one must install the Blockrun plugin:</p>
<pre>openclaw plugins install @blockrun/clawrouter
openclaw gateway restart
</pre>
<p>After installation, the Blockrun wallet must be funded with USDC on the Base network (a modest $5‑10 is sufficient). The wallet address is displayed during the plugin install process. Once funded, the skill can draw on the optional models as needed.</p>
<p>All roundtable results are persisted to the local filesystem for audit and reproducibility. The path follows the pattern:</p>
<pre>{workspace}/memory/roundtables/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.json
</pre>
<p>Where <code>slug</code> is a URL‑friendly version of the topic, and the date reflects when the roundtable was executed. This logging enables users to revisit past discussions, trace the evolution of opinions, and reuse prior <code>CURRENT_CONTEXT</code> blocks to avoid redundant web searches within a session.</p>
<p>In practical terms, the roundtable‑adaptive skill shines when tackling complex, multifaceted problems that benefit from divergent viewpoints. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strategic business analysis where market trends, competitor moves, and regulatory risks must be weighed.</li>
<li>Technical architecture decisions that require trade‑off evaluations between performance, scalability, and security.</li>
<li>Creative brainstorming sessions where novelty and feasibility need to be balanced.</li>
<li>Policy or ethical deliberations that demand scrutiny from multiple philosophical standpoints.</li>
</ul>
<p>By forcing the AI agents to articulate, critique, and refine their positions, the skill mitigates common pitfalls of single‑model outputs such as overconfidence, blind spots, or superficial reasoning.</p>
<p>The design also emphasizes <strong>session persistence</strong>. Because panel agents remain active in a Discord thread, users can pose follow‑up questions, request clarifications, or dive deeper into specific arguments without re‑invoking the entire orchestrator. This turns a one‑off query into an ongoing collaborative workspace, mirroring the way human experts might continue a discussion over days or weeks.</p>
<p>Finally, the skill’s reliance on configurable files (<code>panels.json</code>, <code>openclaw.json</code>, <code>AGENTS.md</code>) makes it highly adaptable to different environments. Teams can tailor the model roster, adjust cost controls, define default output channels, and even customize the meta‑panel prompts to align with organizational standards or domain‑specific terminology.</p>
<p>In summary, the OpenClaw roundtable‑adaptive skill is a powerful orchestration layer that transforms a simple prompt into a structured, multi‑model debate. By combining web‑grounded context, a meta‑panel‑driven workflow design, persistent debate agents, and a formal consensus synthesis, it delivers higher‑quality, more reliable AI output than a solitary model could achieve. Whether you are seeking rapid insights with the <code>--quick</code> flag or undertaking a deep, cost‑aware analysis with the full panel, the skill provides the flexibility and transparency needed to harness the collective intelligence of today’s leading AI systems.</p>
