<h2>What is Context Builder?</h2>
<p>Context Builder is an agentic skill designed to generate a single, structured markdown file from any codebase directory. The output is meticulously optimized for Large Language Model (LLM) consumption, featuring relevance-based file ordering, AST-aware code signatures, automatic token budgeting, and smart defaults that make it incredibly powerful for developers, researchers, and AI agents.</p>
<h2>Core Features and Capabilities</h2>
<h3>LLM-Optimized Output</h3>
<p>The tool creates markdown files specifically structured for LLM consumption. Files are sorted by relevance (configuration and documentation first, then source code, tests, and build files), making it easy for AI models to understand the codebase structure and priorities.</p>
<h3>AST-Aware Code Signatures</h3>
<p>One of the most powerful features is the ability to extract Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) signatures from code. Instead of including entire source files, Context Builder can extract function signatures, class definitions, and method declarations, dramatically reducing token usage while preserving structural understanding. This is particularly useful when working with token-limited models.</p>
<h3>Smart Token Budgeting</h3>
<p>The tool includes intelligent token counting and budgeting features. You can set maximum token limits (e.g., 100,000 tokens for most models or 200,000 for larger models like Gemini), and Context Builder will automatically include files in relevance order until the budget is exhausted. It also provides token count previews before generation, helping you make informed decisions about filtering and optimization strategies.</p>
<h2>Security and Path Scoping</h2>
<p>Security is a top priority with Context Builder. The tool implements strict path scoping rules to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive information. Agents must always use absolute paths and target explicit project directories rather than home directories, system paths, or credential stores. The tool automatically excludes sensitive directories like .git/, node_modules/, and various cache directories, respects .gitignore rules when present, and detects binary files to skip them.</p>
<h3>Best Practices for Secure Usage</h3>
<p>Always write output to project-local paths like docs/ or /tmp/, never to shared or public locations. Review the output before sharing, as it may contain embedded API keys, secrets, or credentials from source files. Use .gitignore patterns to exclude sensitive files when possible.</p>
<h2>Installation and Setup</h2>
<p>Context Builder requires the Rust toolchain and builds from source with cryptographic verification via crates.io. Install it with:</p>
<pre><code>cargo install context-builder --features tree-sitter-all
</code></pre>
<p>Pre-built binaries with SHA256 checksums are also available from GitHub Releases. Verify your installation with:</p>
<pre><code>context-builder --version
</code></pre>
<h2>Core Workflows</h2>
<h3>Quick Context Generation</h3>
<p>For a complete project overview, use:</p>
<pre><code>context-builder -d /path/to/project -y -o context.md
</code></pre>
<p>The -y flag skips confirmation prompts, which is recommended for agent workflows when you have explicitly scoped the path.</p>
<h3>Scoped Context with File Filtering</h3>
<p>To focus on specific file types:</p>
<pre><code>context-builder -d /path/to/project -f rs,toml -i docs,assets -y -o context.md
</code></pre>
<p>This includes only Rust and TOML files while excluding docs and assets directories.</p>
<h3>AST Signatures Mode</h3>
<p>For minimal token usage:</p>
<pre><code>context-builder -d /path/to/project --signatures -f rs,ts,py -y -o signatures.md
</code></pre>
<p>This replaces full file content with extracted signatures, typically reducing tokens by 80-90%.</p>
<h3>Budget-Constrained Context</h3>
<p>To work within token limits:</p>
<pre><code>context-builder -d /path/to/project --max-tokens 100000 -y -o context.md
</code></pre>
<p>Files are included in relevance order until the budget is exhausted, with automatic warnings if output exceeds 128K tokens.</p>
<h2>Advanced Features</h2>
<h3>Incremental Diffs</h3>
<p>Context Builder supports incremental updates through diff caching. First, ensure context-builder.toml exists with timestamped_output = true and auto_diff = true. Then run the tool twice: first for a baseline snapshot, then after code changes for diff annotations. Use &#8211;diff-only for minimal output containing only changes.</p>
<h3>Structural Summary</h3>
<p>Combine signatures with structural summaries using &#8211;structure to append counts like &#8220;6 functions, 2 structs, 1 impl block.&#8221; Pair with &#8211;visibility public to show only public API surface.</p>
<h3>Smart Defaults</h3>
<p>Context Builder includes intelligent defaults that require no configuration: automatic exclusion of heavy directories like node_modules, dist, build, __pycache__, .venv, vendor, and 12 more; self-exclusion of output files and cache directories; automatic .gitignore respect when .git directories exist; binary file detection via UTF-8 sniffing; and intelligent file ordering.</p>
<h2>CLI Reference</h2>
<h3>Essential Flags</h3>
<p>-d <PATH>: Input directory (always use absolute paths for reliability)<br />
-o <FILE>: Output path (write to project/docs/ or /tmp/)<br />
-f <EXT>: Filter by extension (comma-separated: -f rs,toml,md)<br />
-i <NAME>: Ignore directories/files (comma-separated: -i tests,docs,assets)<br />
&#8211;max-tokens <N>: Token budget cap (100000 for most models, 200000 for Gemini)<br />
&#8211;token-count: Dry-run token estimate<br />
-y: Skip all prompts (use only with explicit, scoped project paths)<br />
&#8211;preview: Show file tree only<br />
&#8211;diff-only: Output only diffs<br />
&#8211;signatures: AST signature extraction (requires tree-sitter-all feature)<br />

&#8211;clear-cache: Reset diff cache</p>
<h2>Practical Recipes</h2>
<h3>Deep Code Review</h3>
<p>Generate focused context and feed it to an LLM for architecture review, bug hunting, and performance analysis:</p>
<pre><code>context-builder -d /path/to/project -f rs,toml --max-tokens 120000 -y -o docs/deep_think_context.md
</code></pre>
<p>Then attach docs/deep_think_context.md and ask for comprehensive analysis.</p>
<h3>API Surface Review</h3>
<p>Extract only public signatures for API documentation:</p>
<pre><code>context-builder -d /path/to/project --signatures --visibility public -f rs -y -o docs/api_surface.md
</code></pre>
<p>This typically provides 80-90% token reduction while preserving public API understanding.</p>
<h3>Compare Two Versions</h3>
<p>Generate context for both versions and feed them to an LLM for comparative analysis:</p>
<pre><code>context-builder -d ./v1 -f py -y -o /tmp/v1_context.md
context-builder -d ./v2 -f py -y -o /tmp/v2_context.md
</code></pre>
<h3>Monorepo Slice</h3>
<p>Focus on a specific package within a monorepo:</p>
<pre><code>context-builder -d /path/to/monorepo/packages/core -f ts,tsx -i __tests__,__mocks__ -y -o core_context.md
</code></pre>
<h2>Supported Languages and Extensions</h2>
<p>Context Builder supports 8 languages for AST signature extraction: Rust (.rs), JavaScript (.js/.jsx), TypeScript (.ts/.tsx), Python (.py), Go (.go), Java (.java), C (.c), and C++ (.cpp). The tool automatically detects and processes these file types based on their extensions.</p>
<h2>Token Efficiency and Optimization</h2>
<p>The tool is designed for maximum token efficiency. Full source files typically consume 15K+ tokens each, while AST signatures reduce this to around 4K tokens per file. The relevance-based ordering ensures that the most important files (configuration, documentation, entry points) are included first, maximizing the value of limited token budgets.</p>
<h2>Cross-Project Research</h2>
<p>Context Builder excels at cross-project research by allowing quick packaging of dependency source for analysis. This is invaluable for understanding third-party libraries, comparing implementations across projects, or conducting comprehensive codebase studies.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Context Builder represents a significant advancement in how we interact with codebases through AI and LLM systems. By providing structured, optimized, and secure context generation, it enables deeper code analysis, faster onboarding, and more effective AI-assisted development workflows. Whether you&#8217;re conducting deep code reviews, generating API documentation, or performing cross-project research, Context Builder provides the tools and features needed to work efficiently with large codebases in the age of AI.</p>
