<h1>Introduction to the Pixel Lobster</h1>
<p>In the ever-evolving world of AI agents, visual representation plays a crucial role in user interaction. The Pixel Lobster for OpenClaw is more than just a desktop ornament; it is a fully integrated, animated avatar that provides a tangible focal point for your AI&#8217;s voice. Built as a transparent desktop overlay, this charming pixel-art crustacean brings your agent to life by lip-syncing to your TTS (Text-to-Speech) output.</p>
<h2>What Does the Pixel Lobster Do?</h2>
<p>The core functionality of the Pixel Lobster is to act as a visual manifestation of your AI agent. When your agent speaks, the lobster animates, moving its mouth in sync with the speech patterns detected from your local TTS server. This creates a more natural and engaging communication experience. Unlike generic visualizations that might react to any system audio, the Pixel Lobster is designed to be intelligent—it reacts specifically to AI speech, ensuring that the visual performance remains consistent with the agent&#8217;s intent.</p>
<h2>Key Features and Functionality</h2>
<p>The skill leverages advanced envelope data polling to ensure smooth performance. Because the lobster only monitors the audio envelope from your TTS server, it remains highly efficient with almost zero perceptible CPU impact. Key features include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Smart Lip-Syncing:</strong> Uses six distinct visemes (A-F) plus a closed-mouth state to mimic natural speech patterns.</li>
<li><strong>Configurable Desktop Presence:</strong> Allows users to set the scale of the sprite, choose which monitor the lobster lives on, and toggle click-through functionality.</li>
<li><strong>Integrated Software:</strong> The entire Electron-based application is bundled directly within the skill, eliminating the need for complex repository cloning.</li>
<li><strong>Spring Physics:</strong> Incorporates physics-based movement to prevent robotic, repetitive animation cycles.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Getting Started with Installation</h2>
<p>To begin using the Pixel Lobster, ensure your environment meets the necessary requirements: Node.js 18+ and a running TTS server (such as XTTS) that exposes the required audio envelope endpoints. Installation is straightforward:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the <code>&lt;skill_dir&gt;/app</code> directory.</li>
<li>Run <code>npm install</code> to set up the necessary dependencies.</li>
<li>Adjust the <code>config.json</code> file to match your desired setup, including your TTS server URL, lobster scale, and audio mode preferences.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once configured, you can launch the app using the included helper script or via <code>npx electron .</code> from the app directory.</p>
<h2>Fine-Tuning the Lip-Sync</h2>
<p>One of the most impressive aspects of the Pixel Lobster is the ability to adjust the timing of the mouth movements. Because different audio drivers and playback methods can introduce latency, the skill provides a <code>ttsPlayStartOffsetMs</code> setting. If you find the lobster&#8217;s mouth movements are out of sync with the audio, you can simply tweak this value—increasing it to delay the mouth movement or decreasing it to speed it up. This granular level of control ensures that the user experience is polished and professional.</p>
<h2>Understanding the Visemes</h2>
<p>The lobster relies on six specific mouth shapes, or visemes, to animate speech:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A:</strong> Represents the wide-open &#8220;ah&#8221; sound.</li>
<li><strong>B:</strong> Represents the wide grin &#8220;ee&#8221; sound.</li>
<li><strong>C:</strong> Represents the round &#8220;oh&#8221; sound.</li>
<li><strong>D:</strong> Represents the small pucker &#8220;oo&#8221; sound.</li>
<li><strong>E:</strong> Represents the medium &#8220;eh&#8221; sound.</li>
<li><strong>F:</strong> Represents the teeth-focused &#8220;ff&#8221; sound.</li>
<li><strong>X:</strong> The default state for silence or pauses.</li>
</ul>
<p>By cycling through these shapes, the Pixel Lobster avoids the robotic look found in simpler avatars. The integration of spring physics further enhances the fluidity of the animation, making the character feel alive on your desktop.</p>
<h2>Advanced Configuration Options</h2>
<p>The configuration file allows for significant customization. Users can switch between <code>tts</code> mode (where it only reacts to your AI agent) and <code>system</code> mode (where it reacts to all system audio output). Furthermore, the <code>clickThrough</code> setting is an essential feature for power users; when enabled, the lobster stays on your desktop without obstructing mouse clicks, ensuring your productivity remains unaffected while the avatar is active.</p>
<h2>Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>
<p>Navigating the Pixel Lobster is made simple with built-in keyboard shortcuts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>F8:</strong> Cycle the lobster through your connected displays.</li>
<li><strong>F9:</strong> Quickly toggle click-through mode on or off.</li>
<li><strong>F12:</strong> Open DevTools for troubleshooting or advanced customization.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Pixel Lobster is a testament to how small, well-implemented visual cues can drastically improve the human-AI interaction experience. By providing a low-resource, highly configurable, and aesthetically pleasing avatar, OpenClaw has created a tool that makes interacting with local AI agents feel more personal and grounded. Whether you are a developer looking to add a visual layer to your own agents or a hobbyist wanting a cute desktop companion, the Pixel Lobster is an essential installation for any OpenClaw user.</p>
