<h1>Introduction to the OpenClaw Jable Skill</h1>
<p>In the evolving landscape of automation and personal AI assistants, the OpenClaw framework stands out for its modular approach to handling complex tasks. One particularly useful addition to the OpenClaw ecosystem is the <strong>Jable skill</strong>. Designed for efficiency, this tool allows users to programmatically fetch, filter, and rank the latest updates from Jable.tv based on their popularity. In this guide, we will break down exactly what this skill does, how it functions under the hood, and why it is a powerful utility for content curation.</p>
<h2>What is the Jable Skill?</h2>
<p>The Jable skill is a specialized module for OpenClaw that serves as a bridge between the user and Jable&#8217;s latest content. Rather than manually browsing through pages of updates to determine what is trending, this skill automates the entire process. By pulling data from both RSS feeds and the main &#8216;latest-updates&#8217; pages, it calculates the popularity of videos based on like counts and presents the top results in a clean, readable format.</p>
<p>Key features include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Time-Window Filtering:</strong> Users can define a specific lookback window (defaulting to 48 hours) to ensure they are only seeing the most relevant, recent content.</li>
<li><strong>Customizable Rankings:</strong> Users can dictate how many items they want to see (the &#8216;top N&#8217; feature), allowing for quick summaries or deep dives.</li>
<li><strong>Automated Formatting:</strong> The skill standardizes the output, providing a consistent layout with titles, like counts, and direct links.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How the Workflow Operates</h2>
<p>To understand the utility of the Jable skill, it is helpful to look at its underlying workflow. The skill operates through a four-step automated process triggered by a user&#8217;s request:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>RSS Parsing:</strong> The script first reads the latest publish times from the Jable RSS feed. This acts as the anchor for identifying which videos are truly &#8216;recent.&#8217;</li>
<li><strong>Data Aggregation:</strong> It scans the &#8216;latest-updates&#8217; pages of the site to retrieve specific like counts for the items identified in the first step.</li>
<li><strong>Temporal Filtering:</strong> Any videos that fall outside the user-defined time window (e.g., older than 48 hours) are automatically discarded.</li>
<li><strong>Sorting and Reporting:</strong> The remaining data is sorted in descending order based on the number of likes. Finally, the top N items are returned to the user in a designated, easy-to-read style.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Installation and Setup</h2>
<p>Getting the Jable skill running in your OpenClaw environment is straightforward. You can use the ClawHub command-line interface to pull it directly into your workspace:</p>
<pre>clawhub install jable</pre>
<p>Alternatively, if you prefer a manual approach, you can clone or copy the folder into your <code>skills/jable/</code> directory within your OpenClaw workspace. Once installed, the skill is ready for immediate use via the command line or through your integrated OpenClaw chat interface.</p>
<h2>Using the Command Line Interface (CLI)</h2>
<p>For power users or those building automated pipelines, the script can be invoked directly via Python. The script <code>top_liked_recent.py</code> supports several parameters to fine-tune your results:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>--hours</code>: Specifies how far back in time the script should look (default is 48).</li>
<li><code>--top</code>: Determines the number of items in the final output (default is 3).</li>
<li><code>--pages</code>: Sets how many pages of &#8216;latest-updates&#8217; the script should crawl to gather like statistics (default is 10).</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, to find the top 5 most liked videos from the last 24 hours, you would run:</p>
<pre>python3 skills/jable/scripts/top_liked_recent.py --hours 24 --top 5</pre>
<h2>Using the Skill in Conversation</h2>
<p>The true power of the OpenClaw framework is its natural language processing capabilities. You don&#8217;t always need to remember the CLI flags. Within your chat interface, you can simply ask the assistant for what you need. For instance, you can type:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Pull Jable latest updates and show top 5 by likes from last 24h&#8221;</em></p>
<p>The assistant will interpret this instruction, trigger the Jable skill, and return the data in a clear, standardized format:</p>
<p>1️⃣ [Title]<br />❤️ [Likes]<br />🔗 [URL]</p>
<h2>Important Considerations and Limitations</h2>
<p>While the Jable skill is robust, there are nuances to keep in mind. The accuracy of the popularity rankings is dependent on the data captured during the crawl. If a video is very new and appears in the RSS feed but has not yet been indexed on the &#8216;latest-updates&#8217; pages, it may lack like data and be skipped. If you notice incomplete lists, simply increase the <code>--pages</code> parameter to allow the script to scan deeper into the site archives.</p>
<p>Furthermore, ensure your OpenClaw environment has network access to the target site, as the skill relies on web scraping techniques that can be affected by changes to the source website&#8217;s structure or rate-limiting policies.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The OpenClaw Jable skill is a quintessential example of how automation can streamline content consumption. By automating the extraction, sorting, and reporting of trending videos, it saves users significant time. Whether you are managing a media collection or simply want to stay updated on the most popular content without manual effort, this skill provides a reliable and highly configurable solution. Embrace the power of OpenClaw and start automating your content curation today.</p>
