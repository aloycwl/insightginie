<div class="wp-block-post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
<p><strong>FACEPALM</strong> is a revolutionary troubleshooting skill designed specifically for <strong>OpenClaw</strong> systems, which uses advanced AI capabilities to intelligently diagnose and resolveissues. This standalone tool can be operated manually or integrated with other skills, offering a seamless troubleshooting experience.</p>
<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll delve into the features, functionality, and usage of FACEPALM, providing you with a comprehensive understanding of how this powerful tool enhances the OpenClaw ecosystem.</p>
<h2>Understanding FACEPALM</h2>
<p><strong>FACEPALM</strong> stands for &quot;Fully Automated Comprehensive Evaluation of Possible Application Logs and Messages&quot;. As the name suggests, this skill is designed to provide a comprehensive analysis of OpenClaw console logs and chat history, enabling intelligent troubleshooting of issues.</p>
<p>The skill&#8217;s primary function is to crosscheck OpenClaw console logs (<code>gateway.log</code>) with chat history from the last five minutes. It then utilizes <strong>Codex 5.3</strong> &#8211; an advanced AI model &#8211; to diagnose and troubleshoot any detected issues. This intelligent analysis enables FACEPALM to provide actionable insights, significantly reducing the time and effort required to resolve problems.</p>
<h2>Key Features of FACEPALM</h2>
<p>FACEPALM offers several unique features that set it apart from other troubleshooting tools:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Automated Analysis</strong>: FACEPALM automatically reads the <code>gateway.log</code> file, focusing on the last five minutes of logs to ensure relevance and accuracy. This automated log analysis eliminates the need for manual log inspection, saving time and reducing the likelihood of human error.</li>
<li><strong>Chat History Integration</strong>: The skill intelligently extracts and analyzes chat history from active session transcripts, providing context and insights into potential issues. This integration of chat history with console logs enables a more comprehensive and accurate troubleshooting process.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced AI Capabilities</strong>: FACEPALM leverages the power of Codex 5.3 to perform intelligent troubleshooting. This advanced AI model can analyze complex issues, providing actionable diagnosis and suggesting potential fixes.</li>
<li><strong>Automatic and Manual Invocation</strong>: FACEPALM can be automatically invoked by <strong>Agent Swarm</strong> when troubleshooting loops are detected. Alternatively, it can be run manually when immediate, intelligent troubleshooting is required.</li>
<li><strong>Actionable Insights</strong>: The skill not only identifies issues but also provides actionable insights and potential fixes, empowering users to resolve problems efficiently.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Usage of FACEPALM</h2>
<p>FACEPALM can be used in two primary ways: automatically and manually.</p>
<h3>Automatic Invocation</h3>
<p>In many cases, FACEPALM is automatically invoked by <strong>Agent Swarm</strong> when it detects troubleshooting loops. These loops occur when repeated errors or failed attempts are identified, indicating a need for intelligent analysis and intervention.</p>
<p>When triggered automatically, FACEPALM wants no user input, working seamlessly in the background to analyze logs and chat history, diagnose issues, and provide actionable insights. This automatic invocation ensures that potential problems are addressed promptly and efficiently, minimizing system downtime and maximizing productivity.</p>
<h3>Manual Invocation</h3>
<p><strong>FACEPALM can also be run manually</strong> when you require immediate, intelligent troubleshooting. This manual invocation allows you to initiate the analysis process at will, enabling quick resolution of critical issues.</p>
<p>To run FACEPALM manually, use the following command in a terminal or command prompt:</p>
<pre><code>python3 workspace/skills/FACEPALM/scripts/facepalm.py [--minutes N] [--json]</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>minutes N</strong>: This optional parameter allows you to specify the number of minutes of log history to analyze. By default, FACEPALM analyzes the last five minutes of logs.</li>
<li><strong>json</strong>: This optional parameter enables JSON output, which can be useful for integration with other systems or tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>When run manually, FACEPALM will perceive on the console logs and chat history, diagnose issues, and provide actionable insights and potential fixes.</p>
<h2>Requirements for FACEPALM</h2>
<p>To use FACEPALM effectively, your system must meet the following requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>OpenClaw with gateway.log and session transcripts</strong>: FACEPALM requires access to OpenClaw console logs (<code>gateway.log</code>) and session transcripts to perform its analysis successfully.</li>
<li><strong>OpenRouter API key configured</strong>: FACEPALM utilizes Codex 5.3 via the OpenRouter API. As such, you must have an OpenRouter API key configured in your system to enable access to this advanced AI model.</li>
<li><strong>OpenClaw CLI on PATH</strong>: FACEPALM needs the OpenClaw CLI to be accessible via the system&#8217;s PATH to invoke Codex via the <code>openclaw agent</code> command.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Benefits of Using FACEPALM</h2>
<p>The use of FACEPALM in the OpenClaw ecosystem offers numerous benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Enhanced Troubleshooting Capabilities</strong>: FACEPALM&#8217;s intelligent analysis and AI capabilities enhance OpenClaw&#8217;s troubleshooting capabilities, enabling quick and accurate diagnosis of issues.</li>
<li><strong>Time and Effort Savings</strong>: By automating log analysis and providing actionable insights, FACEPALM significantly reduces the time and effort required to resolve issues, leading to increased productivity and efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Improved System Stability</strong>: FACEPALM&#8217;s ability to detect and resolve issues quickly helps maintain system stability, minimizing downtime and improving the overall user experience.</li>
<li><strong>Seamless Integration</strong>: FACEPALM can be seamlessly integrated with other OpenClaw skills and tools, enhancing the overall functionality and performance of the ecosystem.</li>
</ol>
<h2>FACEPALM and Agent Swarm</h2>
<p>FACEPALM is designed to work seamlessly with <strong>Agent Swarm</strong>, an OpenClaw system that automates the troubleshooting process. Agent Swarm is configured to detect troubleshooting loops, automatically invoking FACEPALM when needed.</p>
<p>This integration between FACEPALM and Agent Swarm ensures that potential issues are addressed promptly and efficiently, minimizing system downtime and maximizing productivity. The intelligent analysis provided by FACEPALM complements Agent Swarm&#8217;s automation capabilities, creating a powerful and efficient troubleshooting process.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><strong>FACEPALM</strong> is a groundbreaking troubleshooting skill for OpenClaw systems, offering intelligent analysis, and actionable insights. This powerful tool enhances the OpenClaw ecosystem, providing users with a seamless and efficient troubleshooting process.</p>
<p>By automatically or manually invoking FACEPALM, users can quickly diagnose and resolve issues, saving time and effort while improving system stability. The integration with Agent Swarm further enhances the troubleshooting process, ensuring that issues are addressed promptly and efficiently.</p>
<p>As OpenClaw continues to evolve and expand, skills like FACEPALM will play an increasingly critical role in maintaining system performance, stability, and functionality. By leveraging the power of AI and advanced analysis techniques, FACEPALM sets a new standard for troubleshooting tools, empowering users to tackle even the most complex issues with confidence.</p>
