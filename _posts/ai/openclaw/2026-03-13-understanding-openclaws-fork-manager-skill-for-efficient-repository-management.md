<h1>Understanding OpenClaw&#8217;s Fork Manager Skill for Efficient Repository Management</h1>
<p>In the world of open-source contributions, managing forks with numerous pull requests (PRs) can be a daunting task. OpenClaw&#8217;s Fork Manager skill simplifies this process by automating the synchronization of forks, rebasing PR branches, and managing local patches. Let&#8217;s dive into the details of how this powerful tool can streamline your workflow.</p>
<h2>What is the Fork Manager Skill?</h2>
<p>The Fork Manager skill is designed to help developers manage forks of repositories where they contribute PRs but also use improvements before they are merged upstream. This skill supports local patches, allowing developers to maintain fixes in their production branch even if the upstream PR was closed or rejected.</p>
<h2>Key Features of the Fork Manager Skill</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Sync a Fork with Upstream:</b> Automatically sync your fork with the latest changes from the upstream repository.</li>
<li><b>Check Status of Open PRs:</b> Monitor the status of all open pull requests in your fork.</li>
<li><b>Rebase PR Branches:</b> Easily rebase PR branches onto the latest upstream, ensuring your contributions are up-to-date.</li>
<li><b>Build a Production Branch:</b> Combine all open PRs and local patches into a single production branch.</li>
<li><b>Review Closed/Rejected PRs:</b> Evaluate recently closed or rejected PRs and decide whether to keep them locally.</li>
<li><b>Manage Local Patches:</b> Maintain a list of fixes not submitted or rejected upstream, keeping them in your production branch.</li>
</ul>
<h2>When to Use the Fork Manager Skill</h2>
<p>The Fork Manager skill is ideal for scenarios such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Syncing a fork with upstream</li>
<li>Checking the status of open PRs</li>
<li>Rebasing PR branches onto the latest upstream</li>
<li>Building a production branch that combines all open PRs and local patches</li>
<li>Reviewing closed or rejected PRs and deciding whether to keep them locally</li>
<li>Managing local patches</li>
</ul>
<h2>When Not to Use the Fork Manager Skill</h2>
<p>However, there are situations where the Fork Manager skill is not suitable:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>General GitHub Queries:</b> For issues, PRs, and CI status on any repository, use the <code>github</code> skill instead.</li>
<li><b>Triaging/Ranking/Prioritizing Issues:</b> Use the <code>issue-prioritizer</code> skill for these tasks.</li>
<li><b>Reviewing Code Changes:</b> Before publishing a PR, use the <code>pr-review</code> skill.</li>
<li><b>Creating New PRs:</b> For creating new PRs from scratch (not fork sync), use <code>gh pr create</code> directly.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Execution Model: Orchestrator + Worker</h2>
<p>The Fork Manager skill follows a robust execution model with an orchestrator and worker pattern to ensure resiliency and efficient use of context. The orchestrator, acting as the primary agent, prepares the context and spawns a subagent to execute tasks such as full-sync, status checks, rebasing, etc. The worker then reads the SKILL.md file, follows the workflow, and writes the history.</p>
<p>To monitor progress, the orchestrator checks the worker&#8217;s status every four minutes via <code>sessions_list</code> and <code>sessions_history</code> commands. If the worker is active and progressing, the orchestrator waits. If the worker is stalled or has failed, the orchestrator kills the subagent and spawns a new one. If the worker completes successfully, the orchestrator reads the result and reports it to the user.</p>
<p>The Fork Manager skill also includes a fallback mechanism to handle failures, such as crashes, timeouts, or errors. The orchestrator checks the repository state and spawns a new worker with updated context, including the point where it last stopped. This process can happen up to two times before reporting a failure to the user.</p>
<h2>Context for the Worker</h2>
<p>When spawning a worker, the orchestrator includes crucial information in the prompt to ensure the worker has all the necessary context. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Path of the SKILL.md file</li>
<li>Repository configuration or path</li>
<li>Last entry in the history</li>
<li>Execution mode (full-sync, status, rebase-all, etc.)</li>
<li>Whether the skill is running in cron mode or manually</li>
<li>Any specific user instructions</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cron Mode</h2>
<p>In cron mode, the Fork Manager skill operates efficiently by adhering to specific guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Skip Interactive Prompts:</b> Auto-resolve decisions that don&#8217;t require human input.</li>
<li><b>Rebases:</b> Attempt automatically and report failures.</li>
<li><b>Closed PRs:</b> Report but defer decisions (don&#8217;t drop or keep without human input).</li>
<li><b>Audit Findings:</b> Report but don&#8217;t act.</li>
<li><b>Compact Output:</b> Use a summary format rather than a full verbose report.</li>
<li><b>Checkpoint on Failure:</b> If a rebase fails or the production build has conflicts, write the state to a checkpoint file for the next run to resume.</li>
<li><b>Time Budget:</b> Target less than 10 minutes total. If rebasing 20+ PRs, batch push at the end instead of per-branch.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>Configuration files for the Fork Manager skill are organized per repository in <code>repos/<repo-name>/config.json</code> relative to the skill directory. The configuration file includes various settings such as repository and fork details, local path, main branch, production branch, upstream and fork remotes, auto-resolve conflicts, open PRs, PR branches, local patches, last sync timestamp, and notes.</p>
<h2>Automatic Conflict Resolution</h2>
<p>The Fork Manager skill supports automatic conflict resolution through two methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Flag Invocation:</b> Use the <code>--auto-resolve</code> flag during invocation for ad-hoc, per-execution resolution.</li>
<li><b>Persistent Configuration:</b> Set <code>"autoResolveConflicts": true</code> in the configuration file to always enable automatic resolution for a specific repository.</li>
</ul>
<p>When automatic conflict resolution is enabled, the skill spawns subagents to resolve conflicts, classifying results as trivial, semantic, or unresolvable. The <code>--auto-resolve</code> flag takes precedence over the configuration setting. Users of ClawHub can simply pass the <code>--auto-resolve</code> flag in their command without additional repository configuration.</p>
<h2>Local Patches</h2>
<p>Each entry in the <code>localPatches</code> array represents a branch maintained locally in the production branch without an open PR upstream. Each patch entry includes details such as description, original PR number (if any), reason for closing, reason for keeping, addition date, and review date. This helps keep track of why certain fixes are maintained locally even when they have been rejected or closed upstream.</p>
<h2>Execution History</h2>
<p>Each repository managed by the Fork Manager skill has a <code>history.md</code> file that records all executions as an append-only log. This history file provides valuable context about previous operations, such as what was done in the last execution and which PRs were involved. Before starting any operation, the skill reads the last output from the history file to gain context.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Fork Manager skill is an invaluable tool for developers managing forks with numerous PRs. By automating the synchronization, rebasing, and management of local patches, it streamlines the workflow and helps maintain up-to-date production branches. Whether you&#8217;re syncing forks, checking PR statuses, or managing local patches, the Fork Manager skill offers a comprehensive solution to enhance your development process.</p>
<p>To get started with the Fork Manager skill, ensure you have <code>git</code> and <code>GitHub CLI (gh)</code> installed. Then, explore the configuration options and execution modes to tailor the skill to your specific needs. With the Fork Manager skill, you can effortlessly keep your forks in sync and manage your production branches efficiently.</p>
