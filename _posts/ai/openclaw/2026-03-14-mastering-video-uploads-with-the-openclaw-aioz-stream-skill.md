<h1>Mastering Video Uploads with the OpenClaw AIOZ Stream Skill</h1>
<p>In the modern landscape of digital content, delivering high-quality video streaming experiences is essential. However, the technical overhead of integrating with complex video hosting APIs can be daunting. Enter the <strong>OpenClaw AIOZ Stream skill</strong>—a robust solution designed to streamline the entire lifecycle of uploading, encoding, and publishing video content to the AIOZ network. This guide breaks down exactly what this skill does and how you can leverage it for your projects.</p>
<h2>What is the AIOZ Stream Video Upload Skill?</h2>
<p>The AIOZ Stream Video Upload skill acts as an intelligent intermediary between your local environment or automated workflows and the AIOZ Stream API. It simplifies a multi-step process into an efficient, repeatable flow. Whether you need a simple &#8216;quick upload&#8217; for personal projects or a granular, highly configured upload for enterprise-grade streaming, this skill provides the tools to handle the heavy lifting.</p>
<h2>The Core Workflow: A Three-Step Process</h2>
<p>The beauty of this skill lies in its adherence to the AIOZ Stream API&#8217;s strict, but reliable, structure. To turn a raw video file into a streamable asset, the skill manages three distinct API interactions:</p>
<h3>1. Creating the Video Object</h3>
<p>Before bits are transferred, the skill initializes a video object on the AIOZ servers. This creates the record for your content and returns a unique <code>VIDEO_ID</code>. This step is critical because it allows you to define metadata, such as the video title, description, and privacy settings. If you are using the &#8216;Custom&#8217; configuration, this is where you also specify encoding parameters like resolution, codec (H.264 or H.265), and adaptive bitrate ladders.</p>
<h3>2. Uploading the File Part</h3>
<p>The skill intelligently calculates the file size and generates an MD5 hash of your video file. This verification ensures data integrity during the transfer. It then utilizes multipart form-data to upload your file to the AIOZ platform, complete with necessary <code>Content-Range</code> headers. This method is highly efficient, even for files exceeding 50MB, by breaking them down into manageable chunks.</p>
<h3>3. Completing the Upload</h3>
<p>Once the binary data is transferred, the final step is to invoke the complete endpoint. This signal triggers the backend transcoding process. Once confirmed, your video moves from an &#8216;uploaded&#8217; state to the &#8216;transcoding&#8217; state, ultimately resulting in a processed, streamable file.</p>
<h2>Customization: Beyond Basic Uploads</h2>
<p>One of the most powerful features of the OpenClaw skill is its support for custom configurations. Many platforms force a &#8216;one size fits all&#8217; encoding approach, but the AIOZ Stream skill allows you to tailor the output to your specific needs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Flexible Resolutions:</strong> From mobile-optimized 240p up to breathtaking 8K (4320p), you have full control over the quality options provided to your viewers.</li>
<li><strong>Codec Options:</strong> Choose between H.264 for near-universal compatibility or H.265 (HEVC) for superior compression efficiency on modern hardware.</li>
<li><strong>Adaptive Streaming:</strong> You can define multiple quality tiers (HLS or DASH) to ensure your video plays smoothly on any internet connection.</li>
<li><strong>Granular Audio Control:</strong> Customize sample rates and bitrates, and even handle multi-language audio tracks with ease.</li>
<li><strong>Audio or Video Only:</strong> Need to push an audio-only podcast or a video-only asset? The skill allows for the exclusion of either component in your custom config.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why Choose This Skill?</h2>
<p>If you have ever attempted to script manual API interactions, you know how fragile things can get. Between MD5 hashing, managing session headers, and parsing HTTP responses, there is plenty of room for error. The OpenClaw AIOZ Stream skill mitigates these risks by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Encapsulating Authentication:</strong> It handles your public and secret keys securely, injecting them into the required headers automatically.</li>
<li><strong>Streamlining Response Handling:</strong> It automatically captures the necessary IDs and URLs, presenting you with the direct link once the video is ready.</li>
<li><strong>Providing Debug-Friendly Feedback:</strong> If a video is still transcoding, the skill gives you clear status updates, preventing you from assuming a failure where there is simply a wait time.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To begin, you will need your AIOZ Stream API public and secret keys. The skill is designed to interact with these via simple command-line prompts. For a basic upload, you simply provide the path to your video and a title. For advanced users, the configuration object allows for JSON-based tuning that covers every technical detail, from container types (mpegts vs. fmp4) to specific audio channels.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the OpenClaw AIOZ Stream skill is an essential tool for developers and content creators who want to leverage the performance and cost-effectiveness of the AIOZ ecosystem without getting bogged down in the minutiae of the underlying API documentation. Whether you are building a video-sharing platform or just need a reliable way to host your training content, this skill provides the stability and flexibility you require.</p>
