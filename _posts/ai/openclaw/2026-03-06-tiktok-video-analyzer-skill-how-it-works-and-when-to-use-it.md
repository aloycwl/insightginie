<h2>What Is the TikTok Video Analyzer Skill?</h2>
<p>The TikTok Video Analyzer is an OpenClaw skill that transcribes and analyzes videos from TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter/X, and over 1000 other sites. It processes audio locally, generates transcripts, and answers questions about video content without requiring you to watch the entire video.</h2>
<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>The skill follows a four-step process that ensures users receive immediate feedback while processing continues in the background:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Immediate Acknowledgment</strong>: Sends &#8220;📡 Video received, analyzing&#8230;&#8221; instantly using the message tool</li>
<li><strong>Download &amp; Transcribe</strong>: Downloads the video and generates a transcript using faster-whisper</li>
<li><strong>Answer Questions</strong>: Analyzes the transcript to answer user queries about content, key points, and style</li>
<li><strong>Save Option</strong>: Offers to save the transcript for future reference without re-downloading</li>
</ol>
<h2>When to Use This Skill</h2>
<p>Activate the TikTok Video Analyzer when:</p>
<ul>
<li>You share a video URL from any supported platform (tiktok.com, youtube.com, instagram.com, twitter.com, x.com, etc.)</li>
<li>You ask questions like &#8220;what is this video about,&#8221; &#8220;summarize this,&#8221; &#8220;what are they teaching,&#8221; or &#8220;what&#8217;s the hook&#8221;</li>
<li>You want to ask follow-up questions about a previously saved video</li>
</ul>
<h2>Critical Rules to Follow</h2>
<h3>Rule 1: Immediate First Message</h3>
<p>The very first message must always be &#8220;📡 Video received, analyzing&#8230;&#8221; sent via the message tool. This must happen before any processing begins. Never include this in your final reply text, as it would delay the user seeing it until processing completes.</p>
<h3>Rule 2: No Silence Allowed</h3>
<p>Users must receive a message every 30-60 seconds during processing. If anything takes more than 30 seconds, send &#8220;⏳ Still working&#8230;&#8221; to keep them informed. After downloading, send &#8220;📥 Downloaded! Transcribing now&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<h3>Rule 3: No Personal Commentary</h3>
<p>Never add personal commentary, references to conversation history, or notes about prior usage. Every URL is treated as fresh. Simply run the skill and provide the answer, ending with the save prompt.</p>
<h3>Rule 4: First-Run Warning</h3>
<p>If running for the first time (no cached transcripts exist), warn users upfront: &#8220;⚠️ First time running — downloading the AI model (~150MB). Takes 2-4 minutes once, never again.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Prerequisites Check</h2>
<p>Before first use, the skill checks if dependencies are installed:</p>
<pre><code>which ffmpeg &amp;&amp; python3 -c "import faster_whisper; print('ok')" &amp;&amp; python3 -c "import yt_dlp; print('ok')"
</code></pre>
<p>If anything is missing, guide users to install:</p>
<h3>Mac/local:</h3>
<pre><code>brew install ffmpeg
pip3 install faster-whisper yt-dlp --break-system-packages
</code></pre>
<h3>Linux/VPS:</h3>
<pre><code>apt install -y ffmpeg
pip install faster-whisper yt-dlp --break-system-packages
</code></pre>
<h2>Step-by-Step Flow</h2>
<h3>Step 1: Immediate Acknowledgment</h3>
<p>Send &#8220;📡 Video received, analyzing&#8230;&#8221; via the message tool before any processing begins.</p>
<h3>Step 1b: First Run Warning (if applicable)</h3>
<p>If this appears to be the first time (no cached transcripts exist), warn: &#8220;⚠️ First time running — the AI transcription model needs to download (~150MB). This takes 2-4 minutes once and never again. Grab a coffee ☕&#8221;</p>
<h3>Step 2: Download</h3>
<p>Run:</p>
<pre><code>python3 ~/.openclaw/skills/tiktok-analyzer/transcribe.py --download-only "URL_HERE"
</code></pre>
<p>This returns JSON with status: &#8220;downloaded&#8221; and video_id. If from_cache: true + skip_transcribe: true, go directly to Step 3.</p>
<h3>Step 2b: Progress Message and Transcription</h3>
<p>Use the message tool to send &#8220;📥 Downloaded! Transcribing now&#8230;&#8221; Then run:</p>
<pre><code>python3 ~/.openclaw/skills/tiktok-analyzer/transcribe.py --transcribe-only "VIDEO_ID"
</code></pre>
<p>Replace VIDEO_ID with the video_id from the previous step. Returns JSON with transcript, language, video_id, and from_cache status.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Answer the Question</h3>
<p>Use the transcript to answer whatever the user asked. If no specific question, provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>What it&#8217;s about (1-2 sentences)</li>
<li>Key points / what&#8217;s being taught (bullet list)</li>
<li>Tone / style (educational, entertainment, story, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 4: Offer to Save</h3>
<p>After giving the answer, ALWAYS ask: &#8220;💾 Want to save this transcript so you can ask follow-up questions later without re-downloading? (yes/no)&#8221; Only skip this if from_cache: true.</p>
<p>If yes, run:</p>
<pre><code>python3 ~/.openclaw/skills/tiktok-analyzer/save_transcript.py "VIDEO_ID" 'JSON_DATA'
</code></pre>
<p>Confirm with &#8220;✅ Saved to your video library!&#8221;</p>
<h2>Searching Saved Transcripts</h2>
<p>When users ask about something they&#8217;ve analyzed before:</p>
<ol>
<li>List files in ~/.openclaw/skills/tiktok-analyzer/transcripts/</li>
<li>Read the relevant .json file(s)</li>
<li>Answer from the saved transcript</li>
</ol>
<h2>Error Handling</h2>
<p>The skill handles various errors gracefully:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Private/removed video</strong>: &#8220;This video is private or has been removed. Try a different URL.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>No ffmpeg</strong>: &#8220;You need ffmpeg. Run: brew install ffmpeg (Mac) or apt install ffmpeg (Linux)&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>No faster-whisper</strong>: &#8220;Run: pip install faster-whisper yt-dlp then try again.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Timeout / very long video</strong>: &#8220;That one&#8217;s taking a while — try a shorter clip or check your connection.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Demo Tips</h2>
<p>For impressive demos:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a video you&#8217;ve already analyzed (cache hit = instant response)</li>
<li>First run: Always warn upfront about the 150MB model download</li>
<li>Works on any platform — yt-dlp supports TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit, Vimeo, and 1000+ more sites</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technical Details</h2>
<p>The skill uses faster-whisper for local transcription, ensuring privacy and speed. It supports automatic language detection and can handle various audio qualities. The transcript cache system allows for instant responses to follow-up questions about previously analyzed videos.</p>
<p>Video downloads are handled by yt-dlp, which supports virtually any video platform. The system automatically detects the best available quality and extracts audio for transcription.</p>
<h2>Why This Skill Matters</h2>
<p>In an era of information overload, the ability to quickly understand video content without watching it entirely is invaluable. Whether you&#8217;re researching educational content, analyzing marketing videos, or simply trying to decide if a long video is worth your time, this skill provides instant insights.</p>
<p>The local processing ensures privacy — your videos and transcripts never leave your machine. The caching system makes repeated analysis efficient, and the broad platform support means you&#8217;re not limited to just one video source.</p>
<p>Perfect for researchers, content creators, marketers, students, and anyone who consumes video content regularly and needs to extract information quickly and efficiently.</p>
