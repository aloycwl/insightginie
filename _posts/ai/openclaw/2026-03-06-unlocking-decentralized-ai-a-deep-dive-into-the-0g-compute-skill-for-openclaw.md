<h1>Introduction to 0g-compute for OpenClaw</h1>
<p>As the AI landscape evolves, moving away from centralized monolithic providers toward decentralized, transparent, and secure infrastructure is becoming a priority for developers. The OpenClaw framework has introduced a game-changing integration: the <strong>0g-compute skill</strong>. This powerful tool connects OpenClaw directly to the 0G Compute Network, a decentralized marketplace for AI inference that leverages Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to ensure model integrity and verifiable security.</p>
<h2>What is the 0g-compute Skill?</h2>
<p>In essence, the 0g-compute skill acts as a bridge. It allows OpenClaw users to access affordable, high-performance AI models—such as DeepSeek, GLM-5, and Qwen—while maintaining control over provider selection and verifying the security of the execution environment. Unlike traditional API services where trust is placed entirely in the provider, 0g-compute utilizes hardware attestation (Intel TDX) to verify that the AI model is running exactly as intended within a secure enclave.</p>
<h2>Why Use Decentralized Compute?</h2>
<p>The primary advantage of the 0G Compute Network over traditional alternatives like OpenRouter is the combination of cost-efficiency and verifiable integrity. By utilizing a decentralized marketplace, users can discover providers offering competitive pricing, all while being able to audit the security protocols of the server performing the inference. This shift is critical for developers who require high standards of security for their AI agents but still want to optimize for operational costs.</p>
<h2>Core Workflows and Setup</h2>
<p>Getting started with the 0g-compute skill requires a few specific steps to ensure your environment is secure and functional. Below is a breakdown of how to integrate this into your existing OpenClaw workflow.</p>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>To begin, ensure you have the 0g-compute CLI installed via npm globally (<code>npm i -g @0glabs/0g-compute-cli</code>). You will also need a wallet funded with 0G tokens. Once installed, log in with your private key and configure the network using the provided setup commands. It is crucial to treat your private key with the utmost care, ensuring it remains within your secure local directory (<code>~/.0g-compute-cli/config.json</code>) and is never shared.</p>
<h3>1. Model Discovery</h3>
<p>The marketplace nature of 0G means you have access to a variety of providers. You can list available models using the CLI, filtering them by price, health status, and TEE compatibility. This transparency allows you to make informed decisions about which providers fit your latency and budgetary requirements.</p>
<h3>2. Verifying Provider Integrity</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most important feature of this skill is the ability to run TEE attestation. Before relying on a new provider, you should run the <code>inference verify</code> command. This process performs a full check to ensure the TEE signer address matches the smart contract, validates the Docker Compose hash, and confirms the DStack TEE (Intel TDX) attestation. By performing these checks, you are not blindly trusting a provider; you are verifying their setup through hardware-level proof.</p>
<h3>3. Managing Wallet and Balances</h3>
<p>Because 0G Compute operates on a decentralized economy, you must manage your sub-account balances specifically for inference services. The CLI simplifies this with commands to deposit funds, transfer to sub-accounts, and retrieve funds if necessary. Remember that inference calls will fail if your sub-account balance is depleted, so monitoring your dashboard regularly is a best practice for production environments.</p>
<h3>4. Configuring OpenClaw</h3>
<p>Once you have identified a verified provider, you can obtain a secret key through the CLI. This key is then used to update your <code>openclaw.json</code> file. By adding the provider URL, API key, and model specifications, OpenClaw can route requests to the decentralized endpoint as if it were a standard API provider. Registering these models in <code>agents.defaults.models</code> with a cost set to zero (since you handle billing on-chain) completes the integration.</p>
<h2>Comparing Costs with the Community</h2>
<p>One of the hidden gems in the 0g-compute repository is the included price comparison script. By running <code>scripts/0g-price-compare.sh</code>, you can see real-time side-by-side cost comparisons between 0G providers and OpenRouter. The script utilizes CoinGecko for current token pricing, ensuring your comparison remains accurate and helping you calculate the exact savings percentage achieved by switching to decentralized infrastructure.</p>
<h2>Safety and Security Best Practices</h2>
<p>Security is the cornerstone of the 0g-compute project. As you scale your use of these models, keep these guidelines in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Always Verify:</strong> Never skip the <code>inference verify</code> step for a new provider.</li>
<li><strong>Health Monitoring:</strong> Check provider uptime metrics before routing high-priority traffic.</li>
<li><strong>Fund Management:</strong> Treat your inference sub-accounts like a prepaid balance; keep them topped up to prevent service disruptions.</li>
<li><strong>File Privacy:</strong> Your configuration files contain sensitive authentication data. Ensure your local machine permissions are locked down.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The 0g-compute skill represents a significant leap forward for the OpenClaw ecosystem. By providing the tools to interact with the 0G Compute Network, it empowers developers to build AI agents that are not only more cost-effective but also more transparent. Whether you are a developer looking to reduce operational overhead or a security-conscious user demanding verifiable hardware attestation for your AI models, this integration provides the necessary infrastructure to succeed in the decentralized future.</p>
