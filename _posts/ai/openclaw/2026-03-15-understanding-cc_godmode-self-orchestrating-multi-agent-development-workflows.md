<h2>What is CC_GodMode?</h2>
<p>CC_GodMode is a revolutionary self-orchestrating multi-agent development system that fundamentally changes how software projects are managed. Rather than having a single AI handle everything, CC_GodMode employs eight specialized agents that work together through intelligent delegation and coordination. The core philosophy is simple: you tell the system WHAT needs to be accomplished, and CC_GodMode decides HOW to achieve it through its orchestrated workflow.</p>
<h3>The Orchestrator Role</h3>
<p>At the heart of CC_GodMode is the Orchestrator role. When you interact with the system, you become the orchestrator who plans, coordinates, and delegates tasks to the specialized agents. The Orchestrator never implements anything directly—instead, it serves as the strategic commander that ensures each agent performs its specific function optimally.</p>
<h3>The Eight Specialized Agents</h3>
<p>CC_GodMode employs eight distinct agents, each with specific expertise and tools:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>@researcher</strong> (Knowledge Discovery): Uses WebSearch and WebFetch to investigate technologies, best practices, and documentation</li>
<li><strong>@architect</strong> (System Design): Handles system architecture decisions using Read, Grep, and Glob tools</li>
<li><strong>@api-guardian</strong> (API Lifecycle): Manages API changes and ensures backward compatibility</li>
<li><strong>@builder</strong> (Implementation): Executes the actual coding work using Read, Write, Edit, and Bash tools</li>
<li><strong>@validator</strong> (Code Quality Gate): Ensures code quality through TypeScript compilation and unit tests</li>
<li><strong>@tester</strong> (UX Quality Gate): Validates user experience through E2E tests, screenshots, and accessibility checks</li>
<li><strong>@scribe</strong> (Documentation): Creates comprehensive documentation for all changes</li>
<li><strong>@github-manager</strong> (GitHub Operations): Handles all GitHub-related operations and issue processing</li>
</ol>
<h2>Standard Workflows</h2>
<p>CC_GodMode follows seven standard workflows, each optimized for different types of development tasks:</p>
<h3>1. New Feature Workflow</h3>
<p>This comprehensive workflow handles complete feature development from research to documentation. It can optionally include the @researcher agent for new technology evaluation. The workflow follows this sequence: research → architecture → implementation → dual quality gates (validator + tester) → documentation.</p>
<h3>2. Bug Fix Workflow</h3>
<p>For quick fixes, this streamlined workflow goes directly from builder to dual quality gates, then completes once both gates approve the changes.</p>
<h3>3. API Change Workflow</h3>
<p>Critical API changes require mandatory involvement of the @api-guardian agent. This workflow ensures all API modifications maintain backward compatibility and properly update all consumers.</p>
<h3>4. Refactoring Workflow</h3>
<p>Code refactoring follows a simplified path: architecture → implementation → dual quality gates, without the need for research or documentation steps.</p>
<h3>5. Release Workflow</h3>
<p>Preparing a release involves documentation creation followed by GitHub operations to publish the release.</p>
<h3>6. Process Issue Workflow</h3>
<p>When processing GitHub issues, the @github-manager loads the issue, the orchestrator analyzes it, and then the appropriate workflow is selected.</p>
<h3>7. Research Task Workflow</h3>
<p>Direct research requests go straight to the @researcher agent, which provides findings and recommendations.</p>
<h2>Dual Quality Gates System</h2>
<p>One of CC_GodMode&#8217;s most innovative features is its dual quality gates system. After implementation, both the @validator (Code Quality) and @tester (UX Quality) agents run in parallel for 40% faster validation. Both gates must approve before proceeding to documentation.</p>
<h3>Code Quality Gate (@validator)</h3>
<p>The @validator ensures TypeScript compiles without errors, all unit tests pass, there are no security issues, and for API changes, all consumers are properly updated.</p>
<h3>UX Quality Gate (@tester)</h3>
<p>The @tester validates user experience through E2E tests, creates screenshots at three viewports (mobile, tablet, desktop), ensures accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA), and verifies Core Web Vitals metrics.</p>
<h3>Decision Matrix</h3>
<p>The system follows a clear decision matrix:<br />
&#8211; Both approved: Proceed to documentation<br />
&#8211; Any blocked: Return to builder with specific feedback</p>
<h2>Critical API Change Paths</h2>
<p>CC_GodMode identifies specific file paths that constitute API changes and require mandatory @api-guardian involvement:<br />
&#8211; src/api/**<br />
&#8211; backend/routes/**<br />
&#8211; shared/types/**<br />
&#8211; types/<br />
&#8211; *.d.ts files<br />
&#8211; openapi.yaml/openapi.json<br />
&#8211; schema.graphql</p>
<h2>Version Management and Pre-Push Requirements</h2>
<p>Before any code push, CC_GodMode enforces strict requirements:<br />
&#8211; VERSION file must be updated in project root<br />
&#8211; CHANGELOG.md must be updated<br />
&#8211; README.md updated if user-facing changes exist<br />
&#8211; Never push the same version twice</p>
<p>The system uses semantic versioning:<br />
&#8211; MAJOR (X.0.0): Breaking changes<br />
&#8211; MINOR (0.X.0): New features<br />
&#8211; PATCH (0.0.X): Bug fixes</p>
<h2>Reporting Structure</h2>
<p>All agents save their reports under a version-specific folder structure:<br />
reports/v[VERSION]/00-researcher-report.md, 01-architect-report.md, etc.</p>
<h2>Ten Golden Rules</h2>
<p>CC_GodMode operates under ten fundamental rules:<br />
1. Version-First: Determine target version before any work starts<br />
2. @researcher for Unknown Tech: Use when new technologies need evaluation<br />
3. @architect is the Gate: No feature starts without architecture decision<br />
4. @api-guardian is MANDATORY for API changes: No exceptions<br />
5. Dual Quality Gates: Both @validator and @tester must be green<br />
6. @tester MUST create Screenshots: Every page at three viewports<br />
7. Use Task Tool: Call agents via Task tool with subagent_type<br />
8. No Skipping: Every agent in workflow must be executed<br />
9. Reports in reports/vX.X.X/: All agents save reports under version folder<br />
10. NEVER git push without permission: Applies to all agents</p>
<h2>Implementation Requirements</h2>
<p>CC_GodMode workflows may require:<br />
&#8211; Network access for research and documentation fetching<br />
&#8211; Local binaries for compilation and testing<br />
&#8211; Credentials for GitHub operations and API access</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>CC_GodMode represents a significant advancement in AI-assisted software development. By orchestrating specialized agents through well-defined workflows and quality gates, it ensures comprehensive, high-quality development processes while maintaining clear separation of concerns. The system&#8217;s emphasis on version management, mandatory quality checks, and structured reporting makes it particularly valuable for teams seeking to scale their development processes while maintaining consistency and quality standards.</p>
<p>The beauty of CC_GodMode lies in its ability to handle complexity through intelligent delegation—you focus on defining what needs to be done, while the system handles the intricate details of how to accomplish it through its orchestrated multi-agent approach.</p>
