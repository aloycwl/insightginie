<h2>What is the OpenClaw Inkdrop Skill?</h2>
<p>The OpenClaw Inkdrop Skill is a powerful integration that allows you to interact with your Inkdrop notes directly through OpenClaw&#8217;s skill system. This skill enables you to read, create, update, search, and delete notes using Inkdrop&#8217;s local HTTP server API, making it perfect for managing your thoughts, project backlogs, task lists, and any other information you want to persist in Inkdrop.</p>
<h2>Prerequisites and Setup</h2>
<p>Before you can use the Inkdrop skill, you&#8217;ll need to have a few things in place:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install and run the <strong>Inkdrop desktop app</strong> on your machine</li>
<li>Enable the <strong>Local HTTP Server</strong> in Inkdrop preferences (Preferences → API → Enable Local HTTP Server)</li>
<li>Take note of the port number, username, and password from your Inkdrop preferences</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have these prerequisites, you&#8217;ll need to set up your environment variables:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">export INKDROP_URL="http://localhost:19840" # default port
export INKDROP_AUTH="username:password" # from Inkdrop preferences
</code></pre>
<p>For OpenClaw specifically, it&#8217;s recommended to store these credentials in a secrets file (like workspace secrets.md) and source them at runtime rather than persisting plaintext credentials in your shell profile.</p>
<h2>Connecting to Inkdrop</h2>
<p>The skill connects to Inkdrop using a base URL (default: http://localhost:19840) and Basic authentication via the INKDROP_AUTH environment variable. You can verify your connection works with this simple test:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">curl -s -u "$INKDROP_AUTH" "${INKDROP_URL:-http://localhost:19840}/"
</code></pre>
<p>This should return a JSON response like: <code>{"version":"5.x.x","ok":true}</code></p>
<h2>Core Functionality</h2>
<h3>Managing Notes</h3>
<p>The skill provides comprehensive note management capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>List Notes</strong>: Retrieve all notes or search with specific keywords, limit results, and sort by various criteria</li>
<li><strong>Get Single Document</strong>: Fetch individual notes, notebooks, tags, or files using their document ID</li>
<li><strong>Create Notes</strong>: Add new markdown notes with titles, content, and categorization</li>
<li><strong>Update Notes</strong>: Modify existing notes (requires fetching the current revision token first)</li>
<li><strong>Delete Documents</strong>: Remove notes, notebooks, tags, or files</li>
</ul>
<h3>Working with Notebooks</h3>
<p>Organize your notes into notebooks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>List Notebooks</strong>: View all available notebooks</li>
<li><strong>Create Notebook</strong>: Add new notebooks for better organization</li>
</ul>
<h3>Managing Tags</h3>
<p>Enhance note organization with tags:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>List Tags</strong>: See all existing tags</li>
<li><strong>Create Tag</strong>: Add new tags with custom colors</li>
</ul>
<h3>Handling Attachments</h3>
<p>Manage files and images that can be attached to notes through the files endpoint.</p>
<h3>Changes Feed</h3>
<p>Monitor updates in real-time using the changes feed, which returns notes in the order they were modified. This is particularly useful for syncing or watching for updates.</p>
<h2>Using the Helper Script</h2>
<p>The skill includes a convenient helper script (scripts/inkdrop.sh) that wraps common operations:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># List all notes
./scripts/inkdrop.sh notes

# Search notes
./scripts/inkdrop.sh search "project ideas"

# Get a specific note
./scripts/inkdrop.sh get "note:abc123"

# Create a note
./scripts/inkdrop.sh create "My Note" "book:inbox" "Note content here"

# List notebooks
./scripts/inkdrop.sh books

# List tags
./scripts/inkdrop.sh tags

# Delete a document
./scripts/inkdrop.sh delete "note:abc123"
</code></pre>
<h2>Note Structure and Conventions</h2>
<p>Notes in Inkdrop have a specific structure:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>_id</strong>: Auto-generated note identifier (e.g., note:abc123)</li>
<li><strong>_rev</strong>: Revision token required for updates to prevent conflicts</li>
<li><strong>title</strong>: The note&#8217;s title</li>
<li><strong>body</strong>: Markdown content</li>
<li><strong>doctype</strong>: Always &#8220;markdown&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>bookId</strong>: Notebook ID (use &#8220;book:inbox&#8221; as default)</li>
<li><strong>tags</strong>: Array of tag IDs</li>
<li><strong>status</strong>: One of: none, active, onHold, completed, dropped</li>
<li><strong>pinned</strong>: Boolean to pin to top</li>
<li><strong>share</strong>: private or public</li>
<li><strong>createdAt/updatedAt</strong>: Unix timestamps</li>
</ul>
<p>Common conventions include using &#8220;book:inbox&#8221; as the default notebook for quick captures, matching notebook names when context is clear, using markdown formatting in note bodies, and always fetching the _rev before updating to avoid conflicts.</p>
<h2>When to Use This Skill</h2>

<ul>
<li>Take notes</li>
<li>Save ideas</li>
<li>Manage project notes</li>
<li>Read notes</li>
<li>Search notes</li>

<li>Organize thoughts, project backlogs, or task lists that should persist in Inkdrop</li>
</ul>
