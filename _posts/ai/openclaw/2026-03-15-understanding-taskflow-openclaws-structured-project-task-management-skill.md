<h1>Understanding TaskFlow: OpenClaw’s Structured Project/Task Management Skill</h1>
<p>TaskFlow is a powerful agent skill within the OpenClaw ecosystem that provides structured project and task management capabilities for AI agents. This markdown-first system offers SQLite-backed querying and bidirectional synchronization, making it a robust tool for organizing and tracking work. Here’s a comprehensive breakdown of what TaskFlow does and how it integrates with OpenClaw agents.</p>
<h2>Core Functionality</h2>
<p>TaskFlow operates on the principle that markdown is canonical. This means that all edits occur directly in markdown files, with the SQLite database serving as a derived index rather than the source of truth. The system includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Structured Project/Task/Plan Management</strong>: Organize projects, tasks, and plans in a structured manner.</li>
<li><strong>Markdown-First Authoring</strong>: All data is stored and edited in markdown files.</li>
<li><strong>SQLite-Backed Querying</strong>: Efficiently query tasks and projects using SQLite.</li>
<li><strong>Bidirectional Sync</strong>: Keep markdown files and the SQLite database in sync.</li>
<li><strong>CLI Integration</strong>: Command-line interface for managing tasks and projects.</li>
<li><strong>Apple Notes Integration</strong>: Export project state to Apple Notes on macOS.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Security Considerations</h2>
<p>The <code>OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE</code> environment variable is a critical component of TaskFlow’s security model. It defines a high-trust boundary for the workspace directory. Key security rules include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Source Trust</strong>: Only set <code>OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE</code> from trusted, controlled sources such as shell profiles or systemd user units.</li>
<li><strong>Validation</strong>: Always validate that the path exists before use.</li>
<li><strong>Path Construction</strong>: Never concatenate untrusted user input onto the workspace path. Use <code>path.resolve()</code> and check for path traversal attempts.</li>
<li><strong>Local Paths</strong>: Treat <code>OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE</code> as a local filesystem path only; remote paths are outside the tested configuration.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Setup and Configuration</h2>
<p>Setting up TaskFlow involves several steps to ensure proper configuration and functionality:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Set Environment Variable</strong>: Add <code>export OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE="/path/to/your/.openclaw/workspace"</code> to your shell profile.</li>
<li><strong>Link the CLI</strong>: Create a symbolic link to the TaskFlow CLI.</li>
<li><strong>Run the Setup Wizard</strong>: Use the <code>taskflow setup</code> command to initialize the workspace, create directories, and optionally install the periodic sync daemon.</li>
</ol>
<p>For non-interactive setups, you can use the <code>taskflow setup --name &quot;My Project&quot; --desc &quot;What it does&quot;</code> command.</p>
<h2>Directory Layout</h2>
<p>The TaskFlow directory layout is designed to keep projects, tasks, and plans organized:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;workspace/&gt;
├── PROJECTS.md                      # Project registry
├── tasks/&lt;slug&gt;-tasks.md            # Task list per project
├── plans/&lt;slug&gt;-plan.md             # Optional: architecture/design doc per project
└── taskflow/
    ├── SKILL.md                     # This file
    ├── scripts/                    # CLI and sync scripts
    ├── templates/                 # Starter files for new projects
    ├── schema/                    # SQLite schema
    └── system/                    # System integration files</code></pre>
<h2>Creating a Project</h2>
<p>Creating a new project in TaskFlow involves these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add a block to <code>PROJECTS.md</code> with the project slug, name, status, and description.</li>
<li>Create the task file <code>tasks/&lt;slug&gt;-tasks.md</code> from the template and update the project name.</li>
<li>Optionally create a plan file <code>plans/&lt;slug&gt;-plan.md</code> for architecture and design documentation.</li>
</ol>
<h2>First Run: Agents vs. Humans</h2>
<p>TaskFlow provides different setup procedures for AI agents and human users:</p>
<h3>For Agents:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Detect the current state of the workspace and set up TaskFlow accordingly.</li>
<li>If no projects exist, ask the user for the first project’s name and description.</li>
<li>Run <code>taskflow setup</code> to initialize the database and sync.</li>
<li>Follow up with <code>taskflow status</code> to confirm the setup.</li>
</ul>
<h3>For Humans:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Run <code>taskflow setup</code> to use the interactive wizard for project creation and database initialization.</li>
<li>Optionally install the periodic sync daemon for automatic updates.</li>
<li>For non-interactive setups, use the <code>taskflow setup --name &quot;My Project&quot; --desc &quot;What it does&quot;</code> command.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>TaskFlow is a versatile skill within the OpenClaw ecosystem, providing structured project and task management with markdown-first authoring, SQLite querying, and bidirectional sync. By following the setup and configuration guidelines, users can leverage TaskFlow to organize and track their projects efficiently. Whether you’re an AI agent or a human user, TaskFlow offers a robust solution for managing your tasks and projects.</p>
