<h2>What is the OpenClaw Solo Pipeline Skill?</h2>
<p>The OpenClaw solo-pipeline skill is a powerful automation tool that chains multiple skills into a seamless workflow loop. Instead of manually invoking individual skills one after another, this skill creates an automated pipeline that progresses through stages automatically, significantly reducing the overhead of complex multi-step processes.</p>
<h3>Core Purpose and Use Cases</h3>
<p>The solo-pipeline skill is designed for situations where you need to run multiple related skills in sequence. Common use cases include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Research Pipeline: Automating the journey from initial idea to validated product requirements</li>
<li>Development Pipeline: Streamlining the process from project scaffolding to full implementation</li>
<li>Iterative Workflows: Running repetitive multi-skill processes until completion</li>
</ul>
<p>The skill responds to natural language triggers like &#8220;run pipeline,&#8221; &#8220;automate research to PRD,&#8221; &#8220;full pipeline,&#8221; &#8220;research and validate,&#8221; &#8220;scaffold to build,&#8221; &#8220;loop until done,&#8221; or &#8220;chain skills.&#8221;</p>
<h2>How the Solo Pipeline Works</h2>
<p>The skill operates through a structured process that begins with argument parsing and ends with automated execution of multiple skill stages. Here&#8217;s a detailed breakdown of the workflow:</p>
<h3>1. Argument Parsing and Pipeline Selection</h3>
<p>When invoked, the skill first examines the provided arguments to determine which pipeline type to run. It looks for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pipeline type (first word: research or dev)</li>
<li>Remaining arguments to pass to the launcher script</li>
</ul>
<p>If arguments are missing or unclear, the skill proactively asks the user to clarify their choice between:</p>
<ol>
<li>Research Pipeline &mdash; chains /research to /validate (idea to PRD)</li>
<li>Dev Pipeline &mdash; chains /scaffold to /setup to /plan to /build (PRD to running code)</li>
</ol>
<h3>2. User Confirmation</h3>
<p>Before execution begins, the skill presents a clear summary of what will happen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pipeline: {type}<br />
  <br />Stages: {stage1} &rarr; {stage2} &rarr; &#8230;<br />
  <br />Idea/Project: {name}<br />
  <br />This will run multiple skills automatically. Continue?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This confirmation step ensures users understand the scope of automation before proceeding.</p>
<h3>3. Pipeline Execution</h3>
<p>Once confirmed, the skill launches the first stage of the pipeline. For research pipelines, this means running /research with the provided idea name. For development pipelines, it starts with /scaffold using the project name and technology stack.</p>
<p>The skill leverages the Stop hook mechanism, which automatically handles progression through subsequent stages. Without this hook, users would need to manually invoke each skill in sequence.</p>
<h2>Available Pipelines and Their Outputs</h2>
<h3>Research Pipeline</h3>
<p>The research pipeline follows this chain:</p>
<pre><code>/research -&gt; /validate
</code></pre>
<p>Process flow:</p>
<ol>
<li>Research stage: Generates research.md with initial findings</li>
<li>Validation stage: Creates prd.md with validated product requirements</li>
</ol>
<p>Usage example:</p>
<pre><code>/pipeline research "AI therapist app"
</code></pre>
<h3>Development Pipeline</h3>
<p>The development pipeline is more comprehensive:</p>
<pre><code>/scaffold -&gt; /setup -&gt; /plan -&gt; /build
</code></pre>
<p>Process flow:</p>
<ol>
<li>Scaffold: Creates project structure and basic files</li>
<li>Setup: Configures development environment and dependencies</li>
<li>Plan: Generates implementation plan and architecture</li>
<li>Build: Produces full project with workflow, plan, and implementation</li>
</ol>
<p>Usage examples:</p>
<pre><code>/pipeline dev "project-name" "stack"
/pipeline dev "project-name" "stack" --feature "user onboarding"
</code></pre>
<h2>Advanced Features and Integration</h2>
<h3>Launcher Scripts (Claude Code Plugin Only)</h3>
<p>For users with the solo-factory plugin installed, the skill provides enhanced launcher scripts that create a tmux dashboard with logging capabilities:</p>
<pre><code>solo-research.sh "idea name" [--project name]
solo-dev.sh "project-name" "stack" [--feature "desc"]
</code></pre>
<p>These scripts offer real-time monitoring and better visibility into the pipeline&#8217;s progress. The &#8211;no-dashboard flag can be used when running from within a skill context to disable this feature.</p>
<h3>State Management and Monitoring</h3>
<p>The skill maintains state through YAML frontmatter files that track:</p>
<ul>
<li>Completed stages</li>
<li>Project root directory</li>
<li>Log file location</li>
</ul>
<p>State file locations:</p>
<pre><code>.solo/pipelines/solo-pipeline-{project}.local.md
~/.solo/pipelines/solo-pipeline-{project}.local.md
</code></pre>
<p>Log files are stored at:</p>
<pre><code>.solo/pipelines/solo-pipeline-{project}.log
</code></pre>
<h3>Session Reuse and Cancellation</h3>
<p>Users can re-run pipelines without recreating state files. Completed stages are automatically skipped, allowing for efficient iteration. To cancel a pipeline manually, users simply delete the state file: solo-pipeline-{project}.local.md.</p>
<h2>Monitoring and Debugging</h2>
<p>The skill provides multiple ways to monitor pipeline progress:</p>
<h3>Terminal Dashboard (with Plugin)</h3>
<p>When launched from terminal without &#8211;no-dashboard, a tmux dashboard automatically opens with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pane 0: Work area</li>
<li>Pane 1: Live log tail -f</li>
<li>Pane 2: Status display (refreshes every 2 seconds)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Manual Monitoring</h3>
<p>Without the plugin, users can monitor progress using standard tools:</p>
<pre><code># Watch log file
watch -n2 -c solo-pipeline-status.sh

# Log tail
tail -f .solo/pipelines/solo-pipeline-{project}.log

# Check state file
cat .solo/pipelines/solo-pipeline-{project}.local.md
</code></pre>
<h2>Safety and Best Practices</h2>
<p>The skill implements several safety mechanisms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Always confirms before starting a pipeline</li>
<li>Doesn&#8217;t skip stages &mdash; the hook handles progression</li>
<li>Implements max iterations to prevent infinite loops (5 for research, 15 for dev)</li>
<li>Uses &#8211;no-dashboard when running from within Claude Code skill context</li>
</ul>
<h2>Log Format and Progress Tracking</h2>
<p>The skill maintains detailed logs in a structured format:</p>
<pre><code>[22:30:15] START    | my-app | stages: research -&gt; validate | max: 5
[22:30:16] STAGE    | iter 1/5 | stage 1/2: research
[22:30:16] INVOKE   | /research "AI therapist app"
[22:35:42] CHECK    | research | .../research.md -&gt; FOUND
[22:35:42] STAGE    | iter 2/5 | stage 2/2: validate
[22:35:42] INVOKE   | /validate "AI therapist app"
[22:40:10] CHECK    | validate | .../prd.md -&gt; FOUND
[22:40:10] DONE     | All stages complete! Promise detected.
[22:40:10] FINISH   | Duration: 10m
</code></pre>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The OpenClaw solo-pipeline skill represents a significant advancement in automation for multi-skill workflows. By chaining related skills into coherent pipelines, it eliminates the manual overhead of complex processes while maintaining transparency and control through confirmation steps and detailed logging.</p>
