<h2>What is RALSTP Consultant?</h2>
<p>RALSTP Consultant is an advanced planning skill developed as part of the OpenClaw skills repository. Based on the groundbreaking PhD thesis &#8220;Recursive Agents and Landmarks Strategic-Tactical Planning (RALSTP)&#8221; by Dorian Buksz from King&#8217;s College London (2024), this skill provides a systematic approach to analyzing complex problems by identifying agents, calculating difficulty, and suggesting decomposition strategies.</p>
<h2>Core Concepts of RALSTP</h2>
<h3>1. Agents Identification</h3>
<p>At the heart of RALSTP is the concept of <strong>agents</strong> &#8211; objects with dynamic types that are active during goal state search. Agents are identified by their appearance as the first argument of a predicate in any action&#8217;s effects.</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic vs Static Types:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dynamic types</strong> appear in action effects (e.g., truck, driver in drive actions)</li>
<li><strong>Static types</strong> never appear in action effects (e.g., location)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Real PDDL Example:</strong></p>
<pre><code>(:types
  ambulance police_car tow_truck fire_brigade - vehicle
  acc_victim vehicle car - subject
  ...
)
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, ambulance, police_car, tow_truck, and fire_brigade are agents because they appear in action effects like &#8216;at&#8217;, &#8216;available&#8217;, and &#8216;busy&#8217;.</p>
<h3>2. Passive Objects</h3>
<p>Passive objects are entities that are acted upon but don&#8217;t act themselves. These include packages, cargo, data, files, and in the RTAM example, victims and vehicles that need assistance.</p>
<h3>3. Agent Dependencies</h3>
<p>Agent dependencies define relationships between agents based on what preconditions they satisfy for other agents. These relationships fall into three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Independent</strong>: Agents that don&#8217;t depend on each other</li>
<li><strong>Dependent</strong>: Agents that need other agents&#8217; preconditions satisfied</li>
<li><strong>Conflicting</strong>: Agents that interfere with each other</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Entanglement</h3>
<p>Entanglement occurs when agents compete for shared resources such as time, space, or locations. It&#8217;s measured by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Count of shared predicates</li>
<li>Conflict frequency in goal states</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Real PDDL Example (RTAM &#8211; Road Traffic Accident):</strong></p>
<pre><code>(:durative-action
  confirm_accident
  :parameters (?V - police_car ?P - subject ?A - accident_location)
  :condition (and (at start (at ?V ?A)) (at start (at ?P ?A)) ...)
  :effect (and (at end (certified ?P)) ...)
)

(:durative-action
  untrap
  :parameters (?V - fire_brigade ?P - acc_victim ?A - accident_location)
  :condition (and (at start (certified ?P)) (at start (available ?V)) ...)
)
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, police_car must certify the accident BEFORE fire_brigade can untrap victims, creating a dependency chain. Both actions require being at the same accident_location, creating resource conflict.</p>
<h3>5. Landmarks</h3>
<p>Landmarks are facts that must be true in any valid plan, identified by working backward from goals to initial state. There are three types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fact landmarks</strong>: Propositions that must hold</li>
<li><strong>Action landmarks</strong>: Actions that must be executed</li>
<li><strong>Relaxed landmarks</strong>: Landmarks considering only positive effects</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Real PDDL Example (RTAM Sequential Dependencies):</strong></p>
<p>Goal: (delivered victim1) ∧ (delivered car1)</p>
<p>Required sequence of fact landmarks:</p>
<ol>
<li>(certified victim1) &#8211; police must confirm</li>
<li>(untrapped victim1) &#8211; fire must free them</li>
<li>(aided victim1) &#8211; ambulance must treat</li>
<li>(loaded victim1 ambulance) &#8211; ambulance must load</li>
<li>(at victim1 hospital) &#8211; deliver to hospital</li>
<li>(delivered victim1) &#8211; FINAL</li>
</ol>
<p>Action landmarks follow the sequence: confirm_accident → untrap → first_aid → load_victim → unload_victim → deliver_victim.</p>
<h3>6. Strategic vs Tactical Planning</h3>
<p>RALSTP distinguishes between two levels of planning:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strategic</strong>: Abstract planning level that solves &#8220;what needs to happen first&#8221; while ignoring details</li>
<li><strong>Tactical</strong>: Detailed execution level that solves &#8220;exactly how to do it&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<h3>7. Difficulty Metrics</h3>
<p>The difficulty of a problem increases with:</p>
<ul>
<li>More agents in goal state</li>
<li>More entangled agents (conflicting dependencies)</li>
<li>More inactive dynamic objects not in goal</li>
</ul>
<p>The Buksz Complexity Score can be approximated as: Agent Count × Entanglement Factor.</p>
<h2>Implementation and Usage</h2>
<p>The RALSTP Consultant skill operates in two modes:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Conceptual Mode (Default)</strong>: Uses LLM to apply RALSTP methodology to natural language problems without requiring PDDL files. The agent identifies agents and landmarks conceptually.</li>
<li><strong>Formal Mode (Optional)</strong>: If PDDL domain/problem files are provided, the included scripts/analyze.py can be run to mathematically extract agents and landmarks.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Usage Example:</strong></p>
<p>For any complex problem, simply describe it and the skill will apply RALSTP analysis:</p>
<pre><code>RALSTP analyze: I need to migrate 1000 VMs from datacentre A to B with minimal downtime
</code></pre>
<h2>Output Format</h2>
<p>The skill provides a comprehensive analysis in this format:</p>
<pre><code>## RALSTP Analysis
### Agents Identified
- [list agents and their types]
### Passive Objects
- [list objects being acted upon]
### Dependency Graph
- [which agents depend on which]
### Difficulty Assessment
- Agent Count: X
- Entanglement: Low/Medium/High
- Estimated Complexity: [score]
### Strategic Phase
- [high-level plan ignoring details]
### Tactical Phase
- [detailed execution]
### Decomposition Suggestion
- Split by: [agent type / landmark / location]
- Parallelize: [what can run concurrently]
- Risks: [potential conflicts/entanglements]
</code></pre>
<h2>When to Use RALSTP Consultant</h2>
<p><strong>USE for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Multi-step workflows with multiple actors</li>
<li>Migration/tasks with dependencies</li>
<li>Resource contention problems</li>
<li>Complex orchestrations</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SKIP for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Simple Q&#038;A</li>
<li>Single-task problems</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reference Example: RTAM Domain</h2>
<p>The Road Traffic Accident Management domain from IPC-2014 provides an excellent illustration of RALSTP in action:</p>
<p><strong>Agents (4):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>ambulance &#8211; transports victims to hospital</li>
<li>police_car &#8211; certifies accident/victims</li>
<li>tow_truck &#8211; recovers vehicles</li>
<li>fire_brigade &#8211; untraps victims, extinguishes fires</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Passive Objects:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>acc_victim &#8211; people needing help</li>
<li>car &#8211; vehicles involved in accident</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dependencies (Critical Path):</strong></p>
<p>police_car → fire_brigade → ambulance → hospital</p>
<p><strong>Landmarks Chain:</strong></p>
<p>confirm_accident → untrap → first_aid → load_victim → unload_victim → deliver_victim</p>
<p><strong>Entanglement:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple vehicles must be at same location (accident scene)</li>
<li>Vehicles have limited availability (busy during actions)</li>
<li>Sequence constraints: can&#8217;t deliver before certify</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> High &#8211; 4 agents, tight dependencies, shared locations</p>
