<h2>What is the Skill Authoring Guide?</h2>
<p>The Skill Authoring Guide is a comprehensive framework for creating effective SKILL.md files that extend the capabilities of Clawbot agents. This guide provides developers and AI practitioners with standardized approaches to enhance agent functionality through well-structured skill definitions.</p>
<h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
<p>The guide operates on several core principles that ensure efficient and effective skill creation:</p>
<h3>Core Principles</h3>
<p><strong>1. Brevity is King</strong></p>
<p>The context window is a shared resource among all skills. Since agents are already highly capable, the guide emphasizes adding only what the agent doesn&#8217;t know. Before writing any explanation, ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Is this explanation really necessary?&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Does this paragraph justify the token cost?&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>Prefer concise examples over lengthy explanations.</p>
<p><strong>2. Matching Degrees of Freedom</strong></p>
<p>The guide categorizes tasks by their required precision:</p>
<p><strong>High Freedom</strong> &#8211; Multiple valid approaches exist, context-dependent decisions are needed. Format: Text instructions.</p>
<p><strong>Medium Freedom</strong> &#8211; Preferred patterns exist with some variation allowed. Format: Pseudocode or parameterized scripts.</p>
<p><strong>Low Freedom</strong> &#8211; Fragile tasks requiring consistency. Format: Specific scripts with minimal parameters.</p>
<p>Think of it as: narrow bridges near cliffs need guardrails (low freedom), while wide plains allow various paths (high freedom).</p>
<h2>SKILL.md Structure</h2>
<p>The guide provides a standardized structure for SKILL.md files:</p>
<pre><code>---
name: my-skill-name # Required, lowercase-hyphen, 1-64 characters
description: > # Required, 1-1024 characters
  What it does + when to use it + relevant keywords
license: Apache-2.0 # Optional
metadata: # Optional
author: misskim
version: "1.0"
---
# Skill Title
[Instructions for the agent - free-form markdown]</code></pre>
<p><strong>Required Fields:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>name: Must match directory name, lowercase-hyphen only</li>
<li>description: Acts as skill activation trigger, should be keyword-rich</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directory Structure</h2>
<p>Skills follow a standardized directory layout:</p>
<pre><code>skill-name/
├── SKILL.md          # Required
├── scripts/          # Executable code (Python/Bash/JS)
├── references/       # Detailed documentation (load when needed)
└── assets/           # Static resources (templates, images, data)</code></pre>
<h2>Environment-Specific Considerations</h2>
<p>The guide includes specific considerations for the Clawbot environment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clawbot Agents: Skills are placed in skills/ or ~/.clawdbot/skills/</li>
<li>MiniPC Integration: Can delegate external tasks via nodes.run commands</li>
<li>Sub-agents: Skills can be designed to spawn sub-agents</li>
<li>Security: Only trusted code should be included in scripts/</li>
<li>Maintainability: Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines, move detailed content to references/</li>
</ul>
<h2>Good vs Bad Skill Examples</h2>
<p><strong>Bad:</strong> &#8220;Processes PDFs&#8221; (description too short)</p>
<p><strong>Good:</strong> &#8220;Extracts text/tables from PDF files, fills forms, and merges multiple PDFs. Use when working with PDF documents or document extraction.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Bad:</strong> Explaining Python syntax the agent already knows</p>
<p><strong>Good:</strong> Providing domain-specific knowledge/workflows the agent doesn&#8217;t know</p>
<h2>Benefits and Use Cases</h2>
<p>The Skill Authoring Guide offers numerous benefits:</p>
<h3>For Developers</h3>
<ul>
<li>Standardized approach reduces learning curve</li>
<li>Clear structure improves maintainability</li>
<li>Security guidelines protect systems</li>
<li>Efficiency principles optimize token usage</li>
</ul>
<h3>For Organizations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Consistent skill quality across teams</li>
<li>Easier skill sharing and collaboration</li>
<li>Better resource management</li>
<li>Improved agent performance</li>
</ul>
<h3>For End Users</h3>
<ul>
<li>More reliable agent behavior</li>
<li>Faster response times</li>
<li>Better handling of specialized tasks</li>
<li>Consistent user experience</li>
</ul>
<h2>Real-World Applications</h2>
<p>The guide enables various practical applications:</p>
<h3>Document Processing</h3>
<p>Skills can handle specialized document formats, extract structured data, and automate document workflows that would be tedious for standard agents.</p>
<h3>Data Analysis</h3>
<p>Domain-specific analysis skills can provide tailored insights for industries like finance, healthcare, or scientific research.</p>
<h3>Integration Tasks</h3>
<p>Skills can bridge gaps between different systems, APIs, or data formats that agents typically struggle with.</p>
<h3>Creative Workflows</h3>
<p>Specialized creative skills can assist with design, writing, or multimedia tasks that require specific tools or knowledge.</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To begin creating skills using this guide:</p>
<ol>
<li>Review the agentskills.io standard documentation</li>
<li>Identify gaps in your agent&#8217;s current capabilities</li>
<li>Design your skill following the structure and principles outlined</li>
<li>Test thoroughly in your Clawbot environment</li>
<li>Iterate based on performance and feedback</li>
</ol>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Skill Authoring Guide provides a comprehensive framework for extending AI agent capabilities in a structured, efficient, and secure manner. By following these guidelines, developers can create powerful skills that enhance agent functionality while maintaining optimal performance and reliability.</p>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re building skills for document processing, data analysis, system integration, or creative workflows, this guide ensures your skills are well-designed, maintainable, and effective in real-world applications.</p>
