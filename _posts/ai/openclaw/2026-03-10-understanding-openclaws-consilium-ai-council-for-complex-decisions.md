<p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, tools that enhance decision-making have become invaluable. One such tool is the <a href='https://github.com/openclaw/skills/blob/main/skills/skills/morozsm/consilium/SKILL.md' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Consilium skill</a> in the OpenClaw framework. This article delves into what Consilium does, how it works, and why it stands out from other AI decision-making tools.</p>
<h2>What is Consilium?</h2>
<p>Consilium is a unique skill within the OpenClaw framework that functions as a personal board of AI advisors. Unlike other AI tools that rely on a single model to generate responses, Consilium uses multiple AI models from different providers to analyze and synthesize complex problems. This multi-model approach ensures a more comprehensive and well-rounded analysis, catching blind spots that a single model might miss.</p>
<h2>Key Features of Consilium</h2>
<p>The Consilium skill is packed with features designed to provide thorough, balanced, and insightful analyses. Let&#8217;s explore some of the key features:</p>
<h3>Multi-Model Analysis</h3>
<p>Consilium stands out because it uses genuinely different AI models from various providers. These models bring unique training, perspectives, and reasoning, ensuring a broader range of insights. This approach contrasts with other council skills that might use one model to role-play multiple perspectives.</p>
<h3>Customizable Panel</h3>
<p>Users can customize the panel of AI advisors by selecting models that best fit their needs. The panel can include models from different providers and with various specialties, such as deep thinkers, pragmatists, broad analysts, technical analysts, and contrarians. This customizability allows users to tailor the analysis to their specific requirements.</p>
<h3>Synthesis of Responses</h3>
<p>After collecting responses from the panel of AI models, Consilium synthesizes the insights into a structured format. This synthesis includes consensus points, disagreements, minority opinions, and action items. This structured output helps users quickly understand the key takeaways from the analysis.</p>
<h3>Follow-Up Capabilities</h3>
<p>Consilium allows users to drill deeper into specific insights by engaging with individual panelists. Users can ask for more details or further clarification on specific points, making the analysis more interactive and tailored to their needs.</p>
<h2>How Consilium Works</h2>
<p>The workflow of Consilium involves several steps, each designed to ensure a thorough and insightful analysis:</p>
<h3>Dispatch</h3>
<p>When a user poses a question, Consilium dispatches the question to the selected panel of AI models simultaneously. Each model analyzes the question independently, providing a unique perspective.</p>
<h3>Collect</h3>
<p>After receiving responses from the panel, Consilium collects and organizes the insights. It waits for a user follow-up before proceeding to the synthesis phase.</p>
<h3>Debate (Optional)</h3>
<p>For more complex analysis, Consilium can facilitate a debate round where panelists provide rebuttals to each other&#8217;s insights. This adds an extra layer of depth and ensures even more comprehensive analysis.</p>
<h3>Synthesize</h3>
<p>Consilium synthesizes the collected insights into a structured format, highlighting consensus points, disagreements, minority opinions, and action items.</p>
<h2>When to Use Consilium</h2>
<p>Consilium is particularly useful for complex decision-making scenarios where a single perspective might not suffice. Some common use cases include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Architectural Decisions:</strong> Evaluate the pros and cons of different architectural approaches.</li>
<li><strong>Strategic Planning:</strong> Assess the potential impact and feasibility of various strategic plans.</li>
<li><strong>Conflict Resolution:</strong> Analyze complex conflicts and propose actionable solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Strategies:</strong> Evaluate the risks and potential returns of different investment strategies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Users can activate Consilium by using the <code>/council</code> command followed by their question. For example:</p>
<pre>
	n
/council Should we migrate from monolith to microservices given our 4-person team?

</pre>
<h2>Privacy and Data Handling</h2>
<p>Data privacy is a crucial consideration when using AI tools. Consilium ensures that your question is sent only to the model providers in your panel. Panelist responses are stored in sub-agent session memory and are auto-archived according to your OpenClaw settings. No data is sent to external services beyond your configured model providers.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Consilium is a powerful tool within the OpenClaw framework that leverages multiple AI models to provide comprehensive and insightful analyses. By using genuinely different models from various providers, Consilium ensures a more thorough and nuanced understanding of complex problems. Its customizable panel, synthesis capabilities, and follow-up features make it a versatile and valuable tool for decision-making in various domains.</p>
