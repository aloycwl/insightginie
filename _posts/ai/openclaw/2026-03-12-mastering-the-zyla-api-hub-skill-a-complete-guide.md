<h2>Setting Up the Skill</h2>
<p>Before you can start leveraging the Zyla API Hub Skill, you need to set it up properly. The first step is to obtain an API key from <a href="https://zylalabs.com/openclaw/connect">Zyla Labs</a>.

<p>If the <code>ZYLA_API_KEY</code> environment variable is not already configured, you will need to guide the user through the process. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>
<ol>
<li>Visit the <a href="https://zylalabs.com/openclaw/connect">Zyla Labs website</a> to get an API key. If the OpenClaw plugin is installed, you can also run the command <code>/zyla connect</code>, which will open the browser automatically.</li>
<li>Once you have the API key, add it to the <code>~/.openclaw/openclaw.json</code> file under the path <code>skills.entries.zyla-api-hub-skill.apiKey</code>.</li>
<li>Ensure that the API key is securely stored and never shared directly in chat or any other insecure medium.</li>
<li>Confirm that the configuration is set correctly and proceed to use the Zyla API Hub Skill.</li>
</ol>
<p>By following these steps, you ensure that your OpenClaw AI agent is ready to interact with the Zyla API Hub and perform a wide range of tasks.</p>
<h2>Quick Start with Popular APIs</h2>
<p>The Zyla API Hub Skill offers quick access to some of the most popular APIs, allowing you to integrate them into your workflow with ease. Here are a few examples of how you can leverage these APIs:</p>
<h3>Weather by Zip API</h3>
<p>The Weather by Zip API allows you to fetch weather data based on a zip code. This is useful when users ask about weather conditions, temperature, forecasts, or climate information. To use this API, you would run the following command:</p>
<pre><code>npx tsx {baseDir}/scripts/zyla-api.ts call --api 781 --endpoint &lt;endpoint_id&gt; --params '{"zip":"10001"}'</code></pre>
<p>This command specifies the API ID, endpoint ID, and parameters (in this case, the zip code) required to fetch the weather data.</p>
<h3>Currency Conversion API</h3>
<p>The Currency Conversion API is ideal for users who need to exchange currencies or check forex rates. You can use this API to convert between different currencies by running the following command:</p>
<pre><code>npx tsx {baseDir}/scripts/zyla-api.ts call --api &lt;id&gt; --endpoint &lt;endpoint_id&gt; --params '{"from":"USD","to":"EUR","amount":"100"}'</code></pre>
<p>This command includes the API ID, endpoint ID, and parameters (the source currency, target currency, and amount to convert).</p>
<h3>Email Validation API</h3>
<p>For users who need to validate or verify email addresses, the Email Validation API is a valuable tool. You can check the validity of an email address by running the following command:</p>
<pre><code>npx tsx {baseDir}/scripts/zyla-api.ts call --api &lt;id&gt; --endpoint &lt;endpoint_id&gt; --params '{"email":"test@example.com"}'</code></pre>
<p>This command specifies the API ID, endpoint ID, and the email address to validate.</p>
<p>To explore additional APIs and generate a comprehensive list, you can run the following command:</p>
<pre><code>npx tsx {baseDir}/scripts/generate-popular.ts</code></pre>
<p>This command will regenerate the list of popular APIs with real API IDs and endpoints from the live catalog, ensuring that you have access to the most up-to-date and relevant APIs.</p>
<h2>Discovering APIs with the Zyla API Hub Skill</h2>
<p>In addition to the popular APIs mentioned above, the Zyla API Hub Skill allows you to discover and explore a wide range of APIs by searching the catalog or listing APIs by category. Here’s how you can search for APIs by keyword:</p>
<pre><code>npx tsx {baseDir}/scripts/zyla-catalog.ts search "recipe"</code></pre>
<p>This command will search the catalog for APIs related to the keyword &#8220;recipe.&#8221; You can also list APIs by category, such as Finance, by running the following command:</p>
<pre><code>npx tsx {baseDir}/scripts/zyla-catalog.ts list --category "Finance"</code></pre>
<p>To get the endpoints for a specific API, you can use the following command:</p>
<pre><code>npx tsx {baseDir}/scripts/zyla-catalog.ts endpoints --api 781</code></pre>
<p>This command will retrieve the endpoints for the API with ID 781, allowing you to explore the available options for that specific API.</p>
<h2>Calling APIs with the Zyla API Hub Skill</h2>
<p>Once you have identified the API and endpoint you want to use, you can call the API using the helper script provided by the Zyla API Hub Skill. The basic call syntax is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>npx tsx {baseDir}/scripts/zyla-api.ts call \
--api &lt;api_id&gt; \
--endpoint &lt;endpoint_id&gt; \
--params '{"key":"value"}'</code></pre>
<p>This command specifies the API ID, endpoint ID, and parameters required to make the call. You can also specify the HTTP method (default is GET) by including the <code>--method</code> option:</p>
<pre><code>npx tsx {baseDir}/scripts/zyla-api.ts call \
--api &lt;api_id&gt; \
--endpoint &lt;endpoint_id&gt; \
--method POST \
--params '{"key":"value"}'</code></pre>
<p>To get detailed information about a specific API, you can use the following command:</p>
<pre><code>npx tsx {baseDir}/scripts/zyla-api.ts info --api &lt;api_id&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Additionally, you can check the health of your API key and monitor your remaining quota by running:</p>
<pre><code>npx tsx {baseDir}/scripts/zyla-api.ts health</code></pre>
<p>As a fallback, you can also use curl to make direct API calls:</p>
<pre><code>curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ZYLA_API_KEY" \
"https://zylalabs.com/api/{api_id}/{api_slug}/{endpoint_id}/{endpoint_slug}?param=value"</code></pre>
<p>The URL pattern for making API calls is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>https://zylalabs.com/api/{api_id}/{api_name_slug}/{endpoint_id}/{endpoint_name_slug}</code></pre>
<p>Here, <code>api_id</code> and <code>endpoint_id</code> are numeric IDs used for routing, while <code>api_name_slug</code> and <code>endpoint_name_slug</code> are URL-friendly names for readability.</p>
<h2>Error Handling and Rate Limits</h2>
<p>When using the Zyla API Hub Skill, it’s important to be aware of potential errors and rate limits. Here are some common errors and how to handle them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>401 Unauthorized</strong>: This error indicates that the API key is invalid or expired. To resolve this, ask the user to run <code>/zyla connect</code> or visit <a href="https://zylalabs.com/openclaw/connect">Zyla Labs</a> to get a new key.</li>
<li><strong>403 Forbidden</strong>: This error suggests a subscription issue. The pay-as-you-go plan should handle this automatically, but if the issue persists, ask the user to contact support.</li>
<li><strong>429 Too Many Requests</strong>: This error occurs when the rate limit is exceeded. Check the <code>X-Zyla-RateLimit-Minute-Remaining</code> response header and wait before retrying the request.</li>
<li><strong>404 Not Found</strong>: This error indicates that the API or endpoint does not exist. Verify the IDs using the catalog to ensure that you are using the correct API and endpoint.</li>
<li><strong>5xx Server Error</strong>: This error signifies an upstream API issue. Retry the request after a short delay of 2-5 seconds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Every API response includes rate limit headers, which provide information about your current usage and limits:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>X-Zyla-RateLimit-Minute-Limit</code>: The maximum number of requests per minute.</li>
<li><code>X-Zyla-RateLimit-Minute-Remaining</code>: The remaining number of requests this minute.</li>
<li><code>X-Zyla-API-Calls-Monthly-Used</code>: The total number of API calls used this billing cycle.</li>
<li><code>X-Zyla-API-Calls-Monthly-Remaining</code>: The remaining number of API calls for this billing cycle.</li>
</ul>
<p>By monitoring these headers, you can manage your API usage effectively and avoid hitting rate limits.</p>
<h2>Billing and Pay-As-You-Go Pricing</h2>
<p>The Zyla API Hub Skill operates on a pay-as-you-go pricing model, which means there is no monthly fee. Instead, each API call is billed at the API’s per-call rate. Billing occurs at the end of each cycle via Stripe. To check your current usage and remaining calls within the cycle, you can use the health endpoint:</p>
<pre><code>npx tsx {baseDir}/scripts/zyla-api.ts health</code></pre>
<p>This command provides an overview of your usage, helping you to stay within your budget and manage your API calls efficiently.</p>
