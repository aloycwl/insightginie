<h1>Understanding the OpenClaw Muslim Prayer Reminder Skill: Features and Functions</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/openclaw/skills/tree/main/skills/diepox/muslim-prayer-reminder">Muslim Prayer Reminder skill</a> from OpenClaw is a powerful tool designed to help Muslims worldwide accurately track prayer times and receive timely reminders. This article explores the features and functions of this skill, highlighting how it can enhance your daily prayer routine.</p>
<h2>Overview of the Muslim Prayer Reminder Skill</h2>
<p>The Muslim Prayer Reminder skill leverages the <a href="https://aladhan.com/prayer-times-api">AlAdhan API</a> to provide accurate Islamic prayer times for any location worldwide. It supports a variety of country-specific calculation methods, ensuring that prayer times are tailored to local standards and practices. This skill is part of the OpenClaw ecosystem, which focuses on creating intelligent, user-friendly tools to support daily routines and practices.</p>
<h2>Key Features</h2>
<h3>1. Accurate Prayer Times</h3>
<p>The skill retrieves precise prayer times for Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, and Isha for any given location. Users can query prayer times by city and country or by geographic coordinates. The skill automatically selects the appropriate calculation method based on the country, ensuring accuracy.</p>
<h3>2. Automated Prayer Reminders</h3>
<p>One of the standout features of this skill is its automated reminder system. The skill runs in the background and sends reminders at three crucial times:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>10 minutes before</strong> the prayer time.</li>
<li><strong>At prayer time</strong> (referred to as &#8220;Salat First&#8221;).</li>
<li><strong>5 minutes after</strong> the prayer time, if the user is still engaged in conversation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Customizable Calculation Methods</h3>
<p>The skill supports over 20 country-specific calculation methods, including those for Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, UAE, and more. Users can override the default method if they prefer a different calculation that suits their needs.</p>
<h3>4. User-Friendly Interface</h3>
<p>The skill provides output in both formatted text and JSON, making it easy to integrate with other applications. It also includes a &#8220;next prayer&#8221; feature that shows the name and time remaining for the next prayer, helping users plan their day effectively.</p>
<h3>5. Background Reminders</h3>
<p>The skill&#8217;s automated reminders work seamlessly in the background, even during conversations. This means users can stay focused on their activities while the skill ensures they never miss a prayer. The reminders are triggered by periodic cron jobs that check the prayer times and send alerts accordingly.</p>

<h2>Common Usage Patterns</h2>
<p>Here are some common usage patterns for the Muslim Prayer Reminder skill:</p>
<h3>1. Get Prayer Times for User&#8217;s City</h3>
<pre><code class="language-python">python3 get_prayer_times.py --city "User's City" --country "User's Country" --next --timezone &lt;offset&gt;</code></pre>
<h3>2. Set Up Automated Daily Fetch</h3>
<pre><code class="language-python">from get_prayer_times import get_prayer_times

import json

# Fetch and save times
times = get_prayer_times(city="Rabat", country="Morocco")

with open('prayer_times.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(times, f)</code></pre>
<h3>3. Check Next Prayer</h3>
<pre><code class="language-python">from get_prayer_times import get_prayer_times, get_next_prayer

times = get_prayer_times(city="Rabat", country="Morocco")
next_prayer = get_next_prayer(times, timezone_offset=1)

# GMT+1 for Morocco
print(f"Next: {next_prayer['name']} in {next_prayer['hours_until']}h {next_prayer['minutes_until']}m")</code></pre>
<h3>4. Set Up Automated Reminders</h3>
<p>Follow the <a href="https://github.com/openclaw/skills/tree/main/skills/diepox/muslim-prayer-reminder/references/setup-reminders.md">setup-reminders.md</a> guide to set up automated reminders. This includes creating a daily fetch job (run at midnight) and a reminder check job (run every 5 minutes).</p>
<h2>Important Notes</h2>
<h3>1. Network Requirements</h3>
<p>The AlAdhan API (api.aladhan.com) may be unreachable from some datacenter IPs. To resolve this, use Cloudflare WARP or a similar VPN to route traffic through Cloudflare&#8217;s network.</p>
<h3>2. Accuracy</h3>
<p>For the most accurate results, always use country-specific methods when available. Coordinates provide more accurate results than city names. Times are displayed in 24-hour format (HH:MM).</p>
<h3>3. Timezones</h3>
<p>The API returns times in local time for the queried location. When calculating &#8220;time until next prayer,&#8221; use the appropriate timezone offset.</p>

<h3>Example 2: User Asks &#8220;When Is the Next Prayer?&#8221;</h3>
