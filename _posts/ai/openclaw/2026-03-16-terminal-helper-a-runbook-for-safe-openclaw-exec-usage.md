<h2>What This Skill Does</h2>
<p>The Terminal Helper skill is a practical runbook for using OpenClaw&#8217;s <code>exec</code> tool effectively and safely. Unlike generic terminal tips, this skill provides concrete guidance for how to execute commands in a real workspace environment while maintaining security and predictability.</p>
<h3>Core Operating Principles</h3>
<p>The skill enforces four key principles every time you use exec:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>State intent before execution</strong> &#8211; Always declare what the command does, where it runs, what files it touches, and what output you expect</li>
<li><strong>Default to read-only exploration</strong> &#8211; Use <code>pwd</code>, <code>ls -la</code>, <code>git status</code>, and similar commands before escalating to writes or installs</li>
<li><strong>Prefer sandboxed execution</strong> &#8211; Use sandbox for tests, builds, dependency installs, and exploring unknown repositories</li>
<li><strong>Require explicit confirmation for risky actions</strong> &#8211; Always confirm before deleting files, installing system packages, or changing system settings</li>
</ol>
<h3>Sandbox vs Host Execution</h3>
<p>A critical distinction: sandboxed sessions do not inherit host <code>process.env</code>. Global environment variables and skill-specific configurations apply to host runs only. When working in a sandbox, you must set the environment separately.</p>
<h3>Working Directory Discipline</h3>
<p>The skill emphasizes deliberate directory selection. When diagnosing OpenClaw itself, it works inside your workspace (typically <code>/Users/username/clawd</code>) and explicitly states the working directory for every command.</p>
<h3>Execution Patterns</h3>
<p>The skill promotes single-purpose commands over complex pipelines, making review and approval safer. For long-running commands, it recommends running with a short yield followed by polling the process session.</p>
<h3>Practical Playbooks</h3>
<p>The skill includes troubleshooting guides for common scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;My skill isn&#8217;t loading&#8221; &#8211; Verifies skill location, frontmatter validity, and watcher settings</li>
<li>&#8220;Peekaboo works in Terminal but fails in OpenClaw&#8221; &#8211; Addresses macOS TCC permissions and daemon behavior</li>
<li>&#8220;ClawHub sync rejects my skill docs&#8221; &#8211; Explains quality gate requirements and how to improve documentation</li>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>What It Won&#8217;t Do</h3>
<p>The skill explicitly avoids running remote install scripts, echoing secrets into commands, or making destructive changes without confirmation. It maintains a security-first approach throughout.</p>
<h3>Quick Start Commands</h3>
<p>Common diagnostic commands include <code>pwd</code>, <code>ls -la</code>, <code>git status</code>, <code>rg -n "error|warn|TODO" .</code>, <code>uname -a</code>, and version checks for Node and Python.</p>
<h3>Skill Metadata</h3>
<p>The skill is user-invokable, not model-invokable by default, and includes metadata for operating system compatibility across macOS, Linux, and Windows. It&#8217;s designed to be loaded from bundled skills or workspace-specific locations with workspace taking precedence.</p>
