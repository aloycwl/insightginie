<p>The Amernet AI SaaS skill is a powerful integration that enables businesses to connect their AI-powered chatbots to multiple messaging platforms through the OpenClaw framework. This skill acts as a bridge between your AI SaaS chatbot and popular communication channels like WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, iMessage, and more, creating a seamless omnichannel experience for your customers.</p>
<p>## What the Amernet AI SaaS Skill Does</p>
<p>The primary function of this skill is to forward user messages from any connected messaging channel to your AI SaaS chatbot and return the chatbot&#8217;s response back to the user. What makes this skill particularly valuable is its ability to maintain conversation context on a per-user basis, ensuring that interactions feel natural and continuous regardless of which channel the user chooses to communicate through.</p>
<p>When a user sends a message through any connected channel, the skill identifies the channel name (such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, or Discord) and the user&#8217;s unique identifier on that platform. It then constructs a sender ID by combining these two elements in the format `<channel>:<user_identifier>`. For example:<br />
&#8211; WhatsApp: `whatsapp:+15551234567`<br />
&#8211; Telegram: `telegram:123456789`<br />
&#8211; Slack: `slack:U012AB3CD`<br />
&#8211; Discord: `discord:123456789012345678`</p>
<p>This sender ID is crucial because it allows the AI SaaS platform to maintain separate conversation contexts for each user across different channels, ensuring that the chatbot can pick up conversations where they left off, regardless of the communication method.</p>
<p>## How It Works: Technical Implementation</p>
<p>The skill operates through a straightforward but robust API integration process. Here&#8217;s how it works technically:</p>
<p>1. **Message Reception**: When a user sends a message through any connected channel, the OpenClaw framework captures the message along with channel and user information.</p>
<p>2. **Sender ID Construction**: The skill constructs the unique sender ID by combining the channel name and user identifier.</p>
<p>3. **API Request**: The skill sends a POST request to your AI SaaS instance&#8217;s chatbot API endpoint:<br />
&#8220;`<br />
POST ${AI_SAAS_BASE_URL}/api/v1/chatbots/${AI_SAAS_CHATBOT_ID}/chat<br />
Authorization: Bearer ${AI_SAAS_API_KEY}<br />
Content-Type: application/json<br />
{<br />
  &#8220;sender_id&#8221;: &#8220;<constructed sender_id>&#8220;,<br />
  &#8220;message&#8221;: &#8220;<user message text>&#8221;<br />
}<br />
&#8220;`</p>
<p>4. **Response Handling**: The skill parses the `data.responses` array from the JSON response and returns each item&#8217;s `text` field as a separate message to the user, maintaining the order of responses.</p>
<p>5. **Error Management**: If the API returns an error or is unreachable, the skill gracefully handles this by replying with: &#8220;Sorry, the AI assistant is temporarily unavailable. Please try again in a moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>## Required Configuration</p>
<p>To set up this skill, you&#8217;ll need to configure several environment variables in your `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` file under `skills.entries.amernet-ai-saas.env`:</p>
<p>&#8211; **AI_SAAS_API_KEY**: Your API key from the AI SaaS portal (Settings → API Keys). This key needs &#8220;all&#8221; permissions to function correctly.<br />
&#8211; **AI_SAAS_CHATBOT_ID**: The specific chatbot ID you want to route all messages to. You can copy this from your Chatbots page in the AI SaaS portal.<br />
&#8211; **AI_SAAS_BASE_URL**: The base URL of your AI SaaS instance. The default is `https://saas.salesbay.ai`, but this can be customized if you&#8217;re using a different instance.</p>
<p>## Key Features and Capabilities</p>
<p>### Conversation Context Management</p>
<p>The skill&#8217;s ability to maintain conversation context per user is one of its most powerful features. By using the channel and user identifier as a session key, it ensures that:<br />
&#8211; Users can switch between channels without losing conversation history<br />
&#8211; The AI chatbot maintains awareness of previous interactions<br />
&#8211; Each user has an independent conversation thread<br />
&#8211; Context is preserved even if the user takes breaks between messages</p>
<p>### Omnichannel Support</p>
<p>With support for multiple messaging platforms, businesses can:<br />
&#8211; Meet customers where they already are<br />
&#8211; Provide consistent service across all channels<br />
&#8211; Reduce the need for customers to switch between apps<br />
&#8211; Centralize AI chatbot management while offering distributed access</p>
<p>### Error Handling and Reliability</p>
<p>The skill includes robust error handling to ensure a smooth user experience:<br />
&#8211; Graceful degradation when the AI SaaS API is unavailable<br />
&#8211; Clear error messages that set appropriate user expectations<br />
&#8211; Automatic retry capabilities (when implemented)<br />
&#8211; Fallback responses to maintain engagement</p>
<p>## Use Cases and Applications</p>
<p>### Customer Support Automation</p>
<p>Businesses can deploy their AI chatbot across all customer communication channels, providing 24/7 support without requiring customers to navigate to a specific website or app. Whether a customer prefers WhatsApp, Slack, or Discord, they can get consistent, AI-powered support.</p>
<p>### Sales and Lead Generation</p>
<p>Sales teams can use this skill to engage potential customers across multiple platforms. The AI chatbot can qualify leads, answer product questions, and schedule appointments, all while maintaining conversation context as prospects move between channels.</p>
<p>### Internal Team Support</p>
<p>Organizations can deploy their AI chatbot on internal communication platforms like Slack or Microsoft Teams to handle HR queries, IT support, or general information requests, reducing the burden on human support staff.</p>
<p>### Community Management</p>
<p>For communities built on platforms like Discord or Telegram, this skill enables automated moderation, FAQ responses, and member engagement without requiring community managers to be constantly available.</p>
<p>## Benefits for Businesses</p>
<p>### Increased Accessibility</p>
<p>By connecting your AI chatbot to multiple messaging channels, you eliminate barriers to customer engagement. Users don&#8217;t need to download new apps or remember additional login credentials—they can interact with your business through their preferred communication method.</p>
<p>### Consistent Customer Experience</p>
<p>Regardless of which channel a customer chooses, they receive the same high-quality, AI-powered service. This consistency builds trust and reduces confusion that might arise from channel-specific implementations.</p>
<p>### Operational Efficiency</p>
<p>The skill reduces the need for multiple chatbot implementations across different platforms. Instead of maintaining separate bots for WhatsApp, Telegram, and Slack, you manage a single AI SaaS chatbot that serves all channels.</p>
<p>### Data Centralization</p>
<p>All conversations, regardless of channel, flow through your AI SaaS platform, making it easier to analyze customer interactions, track metrics, and improve your chatbot&#8217;s performance over time.</p>
<p>### Scalability</p>
<p>As your business grows and new messaging platforms emerge, you can easily add support for additional channels without rebuilding your AI chatbot or retraining your team on new systems.</p>
<p>## Advanced Features</p>
<p>### Conversation Reset Capability</p>
<p>The skill includes a conversation reset feature that users can trigger by saying phrases like &#8220;reset,&#8221; &#8220;start over,&#8221; &#8220;clear chat,&#8221; or &#8220;/reset.&#8221; When activated, the skill sends a DELETE request to clear the conversation history:</p>
<p>&#8220;`<br />
DELETE ${AI_SAAS_BASE_URL}/api/v1/chatbots/${AI_SAAS_CHATBOT_ID}/conversations/<sender_id><br />
Authorization: Bearer ${AI_SAAS_API_KEY}<br />
&#8220;`</p>
<p>The skill then confirms the action with the user: &#8220;Conversation cleared. How can I help you?&#8221;</p>
<p>### Status Check Functionality</p>
<p>Users can check the status of the AI chatbot by sending &#8220;/status&#8221; or &#8220;/ping&#8221; commands. The skill responds by making a GET request to the chatbot API and reporting the chatbot name and whether it&#8217;s active, providing transparency about system availability.</p>
<p>## Implementation Considerations</p>
