<h1>Mastering Safe Deletion with the OpenClaw Trash-CLI Skill</h1>
<p>Every Linux power user knows the cold, sinking feeling of executing a <code>rm -rf</code> command, only to realize a split second later that you have just deleted a directory containing critical project files that were not backed up. The standard command-line deletion tool, <code>rm</code>, is unforgiving. It does not send files to a recycling bin; it unlinks them from your filesystem, making data recovery a complex and often impossible task. This is where the OpenClaw <code>trash-cli</code> skill comes to the rescue, providing a robust, safety-conscious alternative for managing your filesystem.</p>
<h2>What is Trash-CLI?</h2>
<p>Trash-CLI is a command-line interface that conforms to the FreeDesktop.org Trash specification. It is the same standard used by major desktop environments like KDE, GNOME, and XFCE. By installing the <code>trash-cli</code> skill via OpenClaw, you essentially bring the convenience of a GUI trash can into your terminal emulator. Instead of permanently deleting your files, <code>trash-put</code> moves them to a secure directory where they retain their original path, deletion timestamp, and file permissions, allowing you to breathe easy after an accidental keystroke.</p>
<h2>Why You Should Transition Away from &#8216;rm&#8217;</h2>
<p>The <code>rm</code> command is a relic of early computing where every byte of disk space was precious. Today, however, our storage capacities are vast, and the cost of human error far outweighs the cost of storing a few deleted files for a few days. The <code>trash-cli</code> tool acts as a safety buffer. It is particularly useful for developers, system administrators, and anyone who spends a significant portion of their day inside the terminal.</p>
<h2>Getting Started: Installation</h2>
<p>Installing this skill is straightforward, regardless of your distribution. OpenClaw makes it easy to integrate into your workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Homebrew (macOS/Linux):</strong> <code>brew install trash-cli</code></li>
<li><strong>Debian/Ubuntu:</strong> <code>sudo apt install trash-cli</code></li>
<li><strong>Arch Linux:</strong> <code>sudo pacman -S trash-cli</code></li>
<li><strong>Fedora:</strong> <code>sudo dnf install trash-cli</code></li>
<li><strong>Python Environment:</strong> <code>pip install trash-cli</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>Core Commands to Know</h2>
<p>The beauty of this skill lies in its simplicity. Once installed, you have five essential commands that cover the entire lifecycle of a file deletion:</p>
<h3>1. trash-put</h3>
<p>This is your new <code>rm</code>. Instead of deleting, it moves your specified file or directory into the trash folder. Unlike <code>rm</code>, which requires the <code>-R</code> flag to delete folders, <code>trash-put</code> handles directories automatically, making it more intuitive to use.</p>
<h3>2. trash-list</h3>
<p>Ever wonder what is sitting in your trash bin? Running <code>trash-list</code> will print out a history of deleted items, complete with the time of deletion and the original path. You can pipe this into <code>grep</code> to quickly find a specific file if you know the name but have forgotten the location.</p>
<h3>3. trash-restore</h3>
<p>If you find that you have trashed something by mistake, this is the command that saves your day. It provides an interactive interface where you can choose which files to return to their original location. You can even use the <code>--overwrite</code> flag if you want to replace files currently in the directory.</p>
<h3>4. trash-empty</h3>
<p>This mimics the &#8216;Empty Trash&#8217; functionality. You can empty the entire bin, or specify a duration to keep files. For example, <code>trash-empty 7</code> will only remove files that have been in the trash for more than seven days. This allows you to maintain a &#8216;buffer&#8217; of deleted files without your disk space filling up.</p>
<h3>5. trash-rm</h3>
<p>If you need to delete a specific file permanently from the trash bin—perhaps for security or privacy reasons—use <code>trash-rm</code>. It accepts patterns, so you can easily clear out all <code>.log</code> files or temporary object files without touching the rest of your deleted items.</p>
<h2>Strategic Implementation and Safety Tips</h2>
<p>The most common question users ask is: &#8216;Should I alias <code>rm</code> to <code>trash-put</code>?&#8217; The documentation for this skill provides an important warning. Aliasing <code>rm</code> directly can be dangerous because the two commands have different semantics. For instance, <code>trash-put</code> does not require the <code>-R</code> recursive flag, whereas <code>rm</code> does. If you rely on the alias and move to a system without this tool, you might type the wrong command and inadvertently cause damage.</p>
<p>A better practice is to use a warning alias. You can add a line to your <code>.bashrc</code> or <code>.zshrc</code> that echoes a message reminding you to use <code>trash-put</code> when you type <code>rm</code>. This builds muscle memory without creating a dangerous environment dependency. If you absolutely must use the native <code>rm</code>, you can bypass the alias by prefixing your command with a backslash, like <code>\rm</code>.</p>
<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>The OpenClaw <code>trash-cli</code> skill is an essential upgrade for any command-line workflow. It provides a safety net for those &#8216;oops&#8217; moments that every power user faces at some point. By integrating this into your daily routine, you move from a destructive deletion model to a recoverable, intelligent file management system. Take control of your data today—install <code>trash-cli</code> and never worry about accidental file deletion again.</p>
