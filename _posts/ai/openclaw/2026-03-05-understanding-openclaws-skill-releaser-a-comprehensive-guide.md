<h1>Understanding OpenClaw&#8217;s Skill Releaser: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
<p>OpenClaw&#8217;s Skill Releaser is a powerful tool designed to streamline the process of releasing skills to ClawhHub. It automates the entire publication pipeline, ensuring that skills are released securely and efficiently. This article will delve into what the Skill Releaser does, how it works, its use cases, and the benefits it offers.</p>
<h2>What is OpenClaw&#8217;s Skill Releaser?</h2>
<p>Skill Releaser is an OpenClaw skill that orchestrates the full skill publication pipeline from an internal repository to ClawhHub. It is designed to handle various aspects of the release process, including scaffolding, OPSEC scanning, dual review (agent and user), force-push release, and security scan verification.</p>
<h2>How Does Skill Releaser Work?</h2>
<p>Skill Releaser operates in two fully automated phases separated by a human gate. Both single and batch releases follow the same model.</p>
<h3>Single Skill Release Process</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Phase 1 (AUTO):</strong> Steps 1-7 — scaffold, validate, stage, scan, review, push</li>
<li><strong>GATE:</strong> User reviews private repo, replies &#8220;approve&#8221; / &#8220;revise&#8221; / &#8220;reject&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Phase 2 (AUTO):</strong> Steps 9-12 — erase history, flip public, publish, verify scan, deliver</li>
</ol>
<h3>Batch Release Process</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Phase 1 (PARALLEL):</strong> Spawn subagents — one per skill, all run Phase 1 simultaneously</li>
<li><strong>GATE:</strong> ONE batch review message with all repo links</li>
<li><strong>Phase 2 (PARALLEL):</strong> Spawn subagents for approved skills, all publish simultaneously</li>
<li><strong>DELIVERY:</strong> ONE batch summary with all links and scan results</li>
</ol>
<h2>Use Cases for Skill Releaser</h2>
<p>Skill Releaser is versatile and can be used in various scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Releasing a Skill:</strong> When a user says &#8220;release {skill}&#8221; or &#8220;publish {skill} to clawhub,&#8221; Skill Releaser handles the entire process.</li>
<li><strong>Preparing a Skill for Release:</strong> When a user says &#8220;prepare {skill} for release&#8221; or &#8220;check release readiness,&#8221; Skill Releaser ensures the skill is ready for publication.</li>
<li><strong>Reviewing a Skill for Publication:</strong> When a user says &#8220;review {skill} for publication,&#8221; Skill Releaser generates a review document for the user to assess.</li>
<li><strong>Cron-Triggered Release Check:</strong> During the refactory pipeline, Skill Releaser performs a release check to ensure everything is in order.</li>
</ul>
