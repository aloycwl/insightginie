<h1>Streamline Your Development Workflow with OpenClaw Project Setup Wizard</h1>
<p>Starting a new project is often the most tedious part of software development. Every time you initialize a new repository, you find yourself performing the same repetitive tasks: creating directory structures, setting up a <code>.gitignore</code>, configuring CI/CD pipelines, writing a basic <code>README.md</code>, and defining Docker files. This manual overhead not only slows down your initial velocity but also introduces inconsistencies across your projects. Enter the <strong>OpenClaw Project Setup Wizard</strong>—a powerful tool designed to eliminate this friction.</p>
<h2>What is the OpenClaw Project Setup Wizard?</h2>
<p>The Project Setup Wizard is an interactive scaffolding tool developed within the OpenClaw ecosystem. It is specifically engineered to generate production-ready project structures for four major programming languages: <strong>Node.js, Python, Go, and Rust</strong>. By leveraging this tool, you can go from zero to a fully configured, best-practice repository in mere seconds.</p>
<h3>Key Features at a Glance</h3>
<p>The wizard doesn&#8217;t just create folders; it understands the conventions of each language and applies industry-standard best practices. Here is what you get out of the box:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Custom Directory Structures:</strong> Follows language-specific idiomatic layouts (e.g., <code>src/</code> for Node/Python, <code>cmd/</code> and <code>internal/</code> for Go).</li>
<li><strong>Smart <code>.gitignore</code>:</strong> Expertly tuned files that ignore IDE artifacts, environment files, and OS-specific debris.</li>
<li><strong>CI/CD Integration:</strong> Ready-to-go configurations for GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and CircleCI, featuring caching and linting.</li>
<li><strong>Docker Support:</strong> Multi-stage Dockerfiles and <code>docker-compose.yml</code> files for streamlined deployment and minimal image sizes.</li>
<li><strong>Best Practices:</strong> Includes linting and formatting configurations like ESLint, Black, golangci-lint, and rustfmt.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Generates a professional <code>README.md</code> with badges and contribution sections.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Getting Started: Installation</h2>
<p>Getting the wizard into your workflow is straightforward. If you are already using ClawHub, simply run <code>openclaw install project-setup-wizard</code>. For manual installations, you can clone the skill directly into your <code>~/.openclaw/skills/</code> directory, ensuring you set the appropriate permissions with <code>chmod +x</code> to execute the setup script.</p>
<h2>Using the Wizard</h2>
<p>The beauty of this tool lies in its flexibility. You can use it in two distinct modes:</p>
<h3>1. The Interactive Experience</h3>
<p>By simply running <code>openclaw run project-setup-wizard</code>, you enter an interactive mode. The tool will walk you through a series of prompts, asking for your project name, desired language, author details, license choice, and which DevOps features (like Docker or CI/CD) you require. It is perfect for when you want to define a project on the fly.</p>
<h3>2. Non-Interactive CLI Power</h3>
<p>For automation enthusiasts or CI/CD scripts, the wizard supports command-line flags. You can pass arguments like <code>--lang python</code> or <code>--ci github</code> to bypass prompts entirely. This is incredibly useful for team environments where you want to enforce a standard project structure across the entire organization. You can even perform a <code>--dry-run</code> to preview exactly what files will be created before committing to the disk.</p>
<h2>Why Does This Matter?</h2>
<p>In modern software engineering, speed and consistency are king. When every project you start shares the same foundational architecture, it becomes significantly easier to switch between repositories. You know exactly where the tests are, you know how to build the Docker image, and you know that the CI pipeline is ready to catch bugs.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the wizard is highly configurable. By modifying the <code>skill.json</code> file, teams can set their own organizational defaults—such as forcing a specific <code>license_type</code> or enabling <code>include_docker</code> by default. This ensures that every developer on your team is aligned with your company&#8217;s coding standards from the very first commit.</p>
<h2>Deep Dive into Generated Templates</h2>
<h3>Node.js</h3>
<p>For Node.js projects, the wizard generates a robust ecosystem including <code>.eslintrc.json</code>, <code>.prettierrc</code>, and comprehensive test directories. The provided <code>Dockerfile</code> uses a multi-stage approach with <code>node:20-alpine</code>, resulting in images around 120MB.</p>
<h3>Python</h3>
<p>Python developers get a structure featuring <code>pyproject.toml</code>, <code>requirements.txt</code>, and a dedicated <code>src/</code> layout. The Docker configuration uses the <code>slim</code> variant, focusing on security by running as a non-root user.</p>
<h3>Go</h3>
<p>Go projects benefit from the inclusion of a <code>Makefile</code>, <code>golangci.yml</code>, and proper separation of <code>cmd/</code> and <code>internal/</code> packages. The Go Dockerfile is particularly efficient, utilizing <code>scratch</code> for final images, often resulting in incredibly lightweight builds under 10MB.</p>
<h3>Rust</h3>
<p>Rust projects are scaffolded with essential <code>Cargo.toml</code> settings, <code>rustfmt.toml</code>, and a directory layout optimized for both unit and integration tests, ensuring that your library or binary is ready for a professional production pipeline.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The OpenClaw Project Setup Wizard is more than just a template generator; it is a productivity multiplier. By standardizing the &#8220;boring&#8221; parts of project initiation, you free up your mental energy to focus on what actually matters: writing code. Whether you are a solo developer building a personal tool or an engineering manager overseeing a fleet of services, the time saved by using this tool is invaluable. Install it, try a dry run, and start your next project on the right foot.</p>
