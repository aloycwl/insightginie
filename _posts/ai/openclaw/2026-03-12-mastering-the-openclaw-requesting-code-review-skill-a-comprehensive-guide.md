<h2>Introduction to OpenClaw&#8217;s Code Reviewing Power</h2>
<p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of AI-driven software development, maintaining code quality while moving at high speeds is the ultimate challenge. The OpenClaw framework introduces a sophisticated mechanism to handle this: the <strong>requesting-code-review</strong> skill. This essential tool acts as a quality gate, leveraging a specialized subagent to analyze, audit, and improve code before it creates a cascade of issues later in the development cycle. By integrating this skill into your workflow, you move from manual, error-prone checking to an automated, standardized verification process.</p>
<h2>What is the requesting-code-review Skill?</h2>
<p>At its core, the requesting-code-review skill is a structured protocol designed to dispatch the <strong>superpowers:code-reviewer</strong> subagent. Its primary purpose is to verify that implemented work meets established requirements. It operates on a simple but powerful principle: <strong>Review early, review often</strong>. By catching issues at the task level rather than at the architectural level, OpenClaw drastically reduces technical debt.</p>
<h2>The Core Workflow: When and Why</h2>
<p>The skill defines clear boundaries for when a review is required, making it an indispensable part of a developer&#8217;s toolkit. These are broken down into mandatory and optional scenarios:</p>
<h3>Mandatory Reviews</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>After each task in subagent-driven development:</strong> Every incremental step is checked, preventing errors from building up.</li>
<li><strong>After completing a major feature:</strong> Ensures that the overall functionality matches the high-level goals.</li>
<li><strong>Before merging to main:</strong> Serves as the final safeguard before code enters production or the primary branch.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Optional (but highly recommended) Reviews</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>When stuck:</strong> A fresh set of AI eyes can often pinpoint why a solution isn&#8217;t working as expected.</li>
<li><strong>Before refactoring:</strong> Establishes a baseline, ensuring that improvements do not accidentally break existing functionality.</li>
<li><strong>After fixing a complex bug:</strong> Confirms that the fix is robust and doesn&#8217;t introduce regressions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technical Implementation: How to Execute</h2>
<p>Executing the skill is straightforward for developers who understand the Git-centric nature of OpenClaw. To use the skill effectively, follow these three steps:</p>
<h3>1. Defining the Git Context</h3>
<p>The subagent needs to know exactly what changed. You generate this context using Git SHA references. You establish a base point (BASE_SHA) and the current point (HEAD_SHA). The skill provides a command-line snippet to capture these effortlessly:<br /><code>BASE_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD~1)</code><br /><code>HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)</code></p>
<h3>2. Dispatching the Subagent</h3>
<p>With the SHAs in hand, you utilize the Task tool, specifically invoking the <code>superpowers:code-reviewer</code> subagent. You are required to populate a template located in <code>code-reviewer.md</code> with specific details:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>{WHAT_WAS_IMPLEMENTED}:</strong> A clear statement of the code changes.</li>
<li><strong>{PLAN_OR_REQUIREMENTS}:</strong> The reference point for expected behavior.</li>
<li><strong>{BASE_SHA} and {HEAD_SHA}:</strong> The commit range for analysis.</li>
<li><strong>{DESCRIPTION}:</strong> A brief, human-readable summary of the objective.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Actionable Feedback Loops</h3>
<p>The output of the reviewer subagent is not just noise; it is actionable data. The skill mandates a specific handling process for the returned assessment: <strong>Fix Critical issues immediately, resolve Important issues before moving forward, and log Minor issues for future sprints.</strong> If the reviewer indicates an issue that you believe is inaccurate, the framework encourages technical pushback, provided it is supported by evidence like code snippets or tests.</p>
<h2>Integration with Development Methodologies</h2>
<p>The true power of this skill lies in how it adapts to different development styles. In <strong>Subagent-Driven Development</strong>, it is woven into the fabric of the process, ensuring no task goes unchecked. For <strong>Executing Plans</strong>, the review acts as a milestone check, ensuring a batch of tasks is sound before proceeding. In <strong>Ad-Hoc Development</strong>, it provides a safety net during experimentation.</p>
<h2>Conclusion: Embracing the Culture of Review</h2>
<p>The requesting-code-review skill is more than just a tool; it is a cultural shift in how OpenClaw projects are managed. By removing the friction of manual review and replacing it with an automated, structured process, teams can maintain a high velocity without compromising on quality. Ignoring these checks, or viewing them as optional &#8220;simple&#8221; tasks, is the fastest way to invite technical debt. To build better software, commit to the process: review early, review often, and let the <code>code-reviewer</code> subagent be your partner in quality.</p>
