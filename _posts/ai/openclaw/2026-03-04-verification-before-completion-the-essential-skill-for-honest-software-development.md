<h2>What is Verification Before Completion?</h2>
<p>Verification Before Completion is a fundamental skill that prevents developers from claiming work is complete without proper evidence. This skill enforces the principle that evidence must precede any claims about completion, correctness, or success in software development.</p>
<p>The core philosophy is simple yet powerful: <strong>evidence before claims, always</strong>. This means you cannot assert that tests pass, bugs are fixed, or features are complete without actually running the verification commands and confirming the results.</p>
<h2>How Verification Before Completion Works</h2>
<p>The skill operates through a strict five-step verification process that must be followed before making any completion claims:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>IDENTIFY:</strong> Determine what specific command proves your claim</li>
<li><strong>RUN:</strong> Execute the full verification command fresh and completely</li>
<li><strong>READ:</strong> Review the complete output, check exit codes, and count failures</li>
<li><strong>VERIFY:</strong> Confirm whether the output actually supports your claim
<ul>
<li>If NO: State the actual status with evidence</li>
<li>If YES: Make the claim with supporting evidence</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>ONLY THEN:</strong> Make your claim</li>
</ol>
<p>Skipping any step means you&#8217;re lying, not verifying. This rigorous process ensures that every claim about work completion is backed by fresh, verifiable evidence.</p>
<h2>Common Claims and Their Verification Requirements</h2>
<p>Different types of claims require different verification approaches. Here are the most common scenarios:</p>
<h3>Tests Pass</h3>
<p><strong>Requires:</strong> Test command output showing 0 failures<br />
<strong>Not sufficient:</strong> Previous runs, assumptions, or &#8220;should pass&#8221; statements</p>
<h3>Linter Clean</h3>
<p><strong>Requires:</strong> Linter output showing 0 errors<br />
<strong>Not sufficient:</strong> Partial checks or extrapolation from similar code</p>
<h3>Build Succeeds</h3>
<p><strong>Requires:</strong> Build command exit code 0<br />
<strong>Not sufficient:</strong> Linter passing or logs that &#8220;look good&#8221;</p>
<h3>Bug Fixed</h3>
<p><strong>Requires:</strong> Test the original symptom and confirm it passes<br />
<strong>Not sufficient:</strong> Code changes without verification of the actual fix</p>
<h3>Regression Test Works</h3>
<p><strong>Requires:</strong> Complete red-green cycle verification<br />
<strong>Not sufficient:</strong> Test passing once without proper TDD verification</p>
<h3>Agent Completed</h3>
<p><strong>Requires:</strong> VCS diff showing actual changes<br />
<strong>Not sufficient:</strong> Agent reports &#8220;success&#8221; without independent verification</p>
<h3>Requirements Met</h3>
<p><strong>Requires:</strong> Line-by-line checklist verification<br />
<strong>Not sufficient:</strong> Tests passing without checking against requirements</p>
<h2>Red Flags &#8211; When to STOP</h2>
<p>There are specific red flags that indicate you&#8217;re about to violate this skill. When you notice any of these, STOP and verify first:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using &#8220;should&#8221;, &#8220;probably&#8221;, &#8220;seems to&#8221;</li>
<li>Expressing satisfaction before verification (&#8220;Great!&#8221;, &#8220;Perfect!&#8221;, &#8220;Done!&#8221;, etc.)</li>
<li>About to commit/push/PR without verification</li>
<li>Trusting agent success reports</li>
<li>Relying on partial verification</li>
<li>Thinking &#8220;just this once&#8221;</li>
<li>Tired and wanting work over</li>
<li><strong>ANY wording implying success without having run verification</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Rationalization Prevention</h2>
<p>Developers often create excuses to skip verification. Here are common rationalizations and their realities:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Excuse</th>
<th>Reality</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&#8220;Should work now&#8221;</td>
<td>RUN the verification</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&#8220;I&#8217;m confident&#8221;</td>
<td>Confidence ≠ evidence</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&#8220;Just this once&#8221;</td>
<td>No exceptions</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&#8220;Linter passed&#8221;</td>
<td>Linter ≠ compiler</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&#8220;Agent said success&#8221;</td>
<td>Verify independently</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&#8220;I&#8217;m tired&#8221;</td>
<td>Exhaustion ≠ excuse</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&#8220;Partial check is enough&#8221;</td>
<td>Partial proves nothing</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&#8220;Different words so rule doesn&#8217;t apply&#8221;</td>
<td>Spirit over letter</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h2>Key Patterns and Examples</h2>
<h3>Tests</h3>
<p><strong>Correct:</strong> [Run test command] [See: 34/34 pass] &#8220;All tests pass&#8221;<br />
<strong>Incorrect:</strong> &#8220;Should pass now&#8221; / &#8220;Looks correct&#8221;</p>
<h3>Regression Tests (TDD Red-Green)</h3>
<p><strong>Correct:</strong> Write → Run (pass) → Revert fix → Run (MUST FAIL) → Restore → Run (pass)<br />
<strong>Incorrect:</strong> &#8220;I&#8217;ve written a regression test&#8221; (without red-green verification)</p>
<h3>Build</h3>
<p><strong>Correct:</strong> [Run build] [See: exit 0] &#8220;Build passes&#8221;<br />
<strong>Incorrect:</strong> &#8220;Linter passed&#8221; (linter doesn&#8217;t check compilation)</p>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Correct:</strong> Re-read plan → Create checklist → Verify each → Report gaps or completion<br />
<strong>Incorrect:</strong> &#8220;Tests pass, phase complete&#8221;</p>
<h3>Agent Delegation</h3>
<p><strong>Correct:</strong> Agent reports success → Check VCS diff → Verify changes → Report actual state<br />
<strong>Incorrect:</strong> Trust agent report</p>
<h2>Why Verification Before Completion Matters</h2>
<p>This skill exists because of painful lessons learned from 24 documented failure memories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your human partner said &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe you&#8221; &#8211; trust broken</li>
<li>Undefined functions shipped &#8211; would crash</li>
<li>Missing requirements shipped &#8211; incomplete features</li>
<li>Time wasted on false completion → redirect → rework</li>
<li>Violates: &#8220;Honesty is a core value. If you lie, you&#8217;ll be replaced.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>The cost of false completion claims is enormous &#8211; broken trust, failed features, wasted time, and damaged professional relationships. Verification Before Completion prevents these failures by ensuring every claim is backed by evidence.</p>
<h2>When to Apply This Skill</h2>
<p><strong>ALWAYS before:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>ANY variation of success/completion claims</li>
<li>ANY expression of satisfaction</li>
<li>ANY positive statement about work state</li>
<li>Committing, PR creation, task completion</li>
<li>Moving to next task</li>
<li>Delegating to agents</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rule applies to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Exact phrases</li>
<li>Paraphrases and synonyms</li>
<li>Implications of success</li>
<li>ANY communication suggesting completion/correctness</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p><strong>No shortcuts for verification.</strong></p>
<p>Run the command. Read the output. THEN claim the result.</p>
<p>This is non-negotiable. Verification Before Completion is about honesty, quality, and professional integrity in software development. It prevents the costly mistakes that come from assuming work is done when it isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>By following this skill, you build trust with your team, deliver reliable software, and maintain the professional standards that distinguish great developers from those who ship broken code.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Using Verification Before Completion</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prevents shipping broken code:</strong> Ensures only verified, working code reaches production</li>
<li><strong>Builds trust:</strong> Team members can rely on your completion claims</li>
<li><strong>Saves time:</strong> Prevents rework from false completion claims</li>
<li><strong>Maintains quality:</strong> Enforces high standards for code completion</li>
<li><strong>Prevents embarrassment:</strong> Avoids situations where code fails in production</li>
<li><strong>Professional integrity:</strong> Demonstrates commitment to honest development practices</li>
<li><strong>Better collaboration:</strong> Clear evidence makes team communication more effective</li>
</ul>
<h2>Real-World Use Cases</h2>
<h3>Feature Development</h3>
<p>Before claiming a feature is complete, run all tests, verify requirements are met, and check the build. This prevents shipping incomplete features that customers will complain about.</p>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<p>After fixing a bug, verify the original symptom is resolved and no new issues were introduced. This prevents the frustrating situation where a fix breaks something else.</p>
<h3>Code Reviews</h3>
<p>Before requesting code review, verify your changes work as intended. This respects reviewers&#8217; time and prevents them from finding obvious issues you could have caught.</p>
<h3>Production Deployment</h3>
<p>Before deploying to production, verify the build passes, tests pass, and requirements are met. This prevents costly production outages.</p>
<h3>Team Collaboration</h3>
<p>When delegating work to team members or agents, verify their completion claims before accepting the work. This maintains quality standards across the team.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Verification Before Completion is not just a skill &#8211; it&#8217;s a professional discipline that separates reliable developers from those who ship broken code. By enforcing the principle that evidence must precede claims, this skill prevents costly failures, builds trust, and ensures quality in software development.</p>
<p>The next time you&#8217;re about to claim work is complete, ask yourself: &#8220;Have I run the verification command? Have I read the output? Does it actually confirm my claim?&#8221; If the answer to any of these is no, STOP and verify first. Your future self, your team, and your customers will thank you.</p>
<p>Remember: No shortcuts for verification. Run the command. Read the output. THEN claim the result. This is non-negotiable.</p>
