<p>If you have dabbled in the world of AI-driven automation or AI agent development, you might have come across the OpenClaw platform. It&#8217;s an innovative tool designed to streamline and simplify the automation of various tasks. One of the skills that stand out within the OpenClaw ecosystem is the <a href='https://github.com/openclaw/skills/blob/main/skills/rmorse/ghapp/SKILL.md'>GitHub App (ghapp)</a> skill. What does this skill do, and how can it benefit developers and teams? Let&#8217;s dive in.</p>
<h2>What is the GitHub App (ghapp) Skill?</h2>
<p>The <code>ghapp</code> skill is designed to give AI agents and automations their own GitHub identity using GitHub Apps. This means that every commit, pull request, and action is attributed to the bot, rather than your personal account. This skill essentially allows you to authenticate your AI agents as GitHub Apps using installation tokens, making the automation process more transparent and accountable.</p>
<h3>Homepage and Metadata</h3>
<p>The skill&#8217;s homepage is hosted on GitHub at <a href='https://github.com/operator-kit/ghapp-cli'>https://github.com/operator-kit/ghapp-cli</a>. It&#8217;s a CLI (Command Line Interface) tool that helps you authenticate and configure your AI agents as GitHub Apps. The skill is maintained by OpenClaw and has a label of <code>brew</code>, indicating it can be installed using Homebrew, a package manager for macOS.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>To install the <code>ghapp</code> skill, you can use Homebrew. The installation command is as follows:</p>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brew install operator-kit/tap/ghapp</pre>
<p>This command will download and install the <code>ghapp</code> CLI tool, allowing you to authenticate your AI agents as GitHub Apps.</p>
<h2>Setting Up the GitHub App</h2>
<p>Once the <code>ghapp</code> CLI tool is installed, you need to set up your GitHub App. The setup process involves entering the App ID, Installation ID, and the path to the private key (.pem). You can do this interactively using the command:</p>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ghapp setup</pre>
<p>This command will guide you through the setup process, allowing you to configure the authentication settings for your GitHub App.</p>
<p>If you want to configure the authentication settings separately, you can use the command:</p>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ghapp auth configure</pre>
<p>This command will let you set the App ID, Installation ID, and the path to the private key. You can also configure how git and gh commands authenticate using the Installation token.</p>
<h2>Using the GitHub App</h2>
<p>After the setup, the <code>ghapp</code> skill provides several commands to help you manage and authenticate your GitHub App. Here are some of the key commands:</p>
<h3>Configure Authentication</h3>
<p>You can configure how the git and gh commands authenticate using the command:</p>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ghapp auth configure [--gh-auth shell-function|path-shim|none]</pre>
<p>The <code>--gh-auth</code> flag allows you to specify the authentication mode:</p>
<ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<li><code>shell-function</code>: This mode auto-authenticates the gh commands via shell integration. It&#8217;s the recommended mode for most use cases.</li>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<li><code>path-shim</code>: This mode uses a wrapper binary for container environments or continuous integration (CI) systems.</li>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<li><code>none</code>: This mode uses a static token in the hosts.yml file.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Check Authentication Status</h3>
<p>You can check the current authentication configuration and diagnostics using the command:</p>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ghapp auth status</pre>
<p>This command will show you the current authentication settings, allowing you to verify that everything is configured correctly.</p>
<h3>Reset Authentication</h3>
<p>If you need to undo all the authentication configuration, you can use the command:</p>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ghapp auth reset [--remove-key]</pre>
<p>The <code>--remove-key</code> flag will remove the private key from the configuration.</p>
<h2>Tokens and Configuration</h2>
<p>The <code>ghapp</code> skill provides commands to manage the Installation tokens and configuration settings. Here are some of them:</p>
<h3>Print Installation Token</h3>
<p>You can print an Installation token using the command:</p>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ghapp token</pre>
<p>This command will print the cached Installation token. If you want to get a fresh token, you can use the <code>--no-cache</code> flag.</p>
<h3>Manage Configuration</h3>
<p>You can manage the configuration settings using the commands:</p>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ghapp config set
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ghapp config get [key]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ghapp config path</pre>
<p>These commands allow you to set, get, and view the path to the configuration file, respectively.</p>
<h3>Update and Version</h3>
<p>You can update the <code>ghapp</code> CLI tool to the latest release using the command:</p>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ghapp update</pre>
<p>And you can print the current version using the command:</p>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ghapp version</pre>
<h2>Authenticating Git and GitHub CLI Commands</h2>
<p>After setting up the GitHub App, all the git and GitHub CLI (gh) commands will use the Installation token for authentication. This means that every commit, pull request, and action will be attributed to the bot account associated with the GitHub App, rather than your personal account.</p>
<p>The Installation tokens are cached locally and are auto-refreshed, providing a seamless and secure authentication process. The configuration for the GitHub App is stored at <code>~/.config/ghapp/config.yaml</code>.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>The <code>ghapp</code> skill offered by OpenClaw is a game-changer for AI-driven automation and GitHub integrations. By allowing AI agents to authenticate as GitHub Apps, it ensures that all actions are attributed to the bot, providing transparency and accountability. This skill simplifies the process of automating various tasks on GitHub and integrating them into your workflow.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking to streamline your GitHub workflows and make the most of AI-driven automation, then the <code>ghapp</code> skill is definitely worth exploring. With its powerful features and user-friendly commands, it&#8217;s a valuable addition to any developer&#8217;s toolkit.</p>
