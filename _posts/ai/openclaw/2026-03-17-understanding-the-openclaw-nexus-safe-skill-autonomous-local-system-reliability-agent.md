<h1>Understanding the OpenClaw Nexus‑Safe Skill</h1>
<p>The OpenClaw project brings together a collection of reusable automation skills that simplify everyday operational tasks. Among them, the Nexus‑Safe skill stands out as a dedicated local system reliability agent. Its primary purpose is to monitor the health of a host, surface actionable diagnostics, and, when explicitly permitted, perform recovery actions such as restarting troubled services. Because it operates entirely on‑premises, Nexus‑Safe guarantees that no metrics, logs, or system data ever leave the server, making it an ideal fit for environments with strict privacy or compliance requirements.</p>
<h2>What Is Nexus‑Safe?</h2>
<p>Nexus‑Safe is packaged as a single Markdown file (SKILL.md) within the OpenClaw skills repository. The file describes a skill that can be loaded into an OpenClaw agent and invoked via slash commands. At version 1.3.0 the skill provides three main commands: <code>/nexus-safe status</code>, <code>/nexus-safe logs</code>, and <code>/nexus-safe recover</code>. Each command is designed to be lightweight, dependency‑minimal, and safe‑by‑default. The skill relies on the widely available <code>psutil</code> Python library for system metrics and assumes that Docker and PM2 are present in the host’s PATH for container and process management.</p>
<h2>Privacy &amp; Security Policy</h2>
<p>The skill’s privacy model is one of its strongest selling points. All data collection and processing happen locally. No outbound network calls are performed after the initial setup phase, which only requires internet access to fetch the <code>psutil</code> package via <code>pip</code>. This ensures that sensitive information such as CPU usage, memory consumption, disk I/O, and service logs never traverses the network. Additionally, the skill adopts a safe‑by‑default stance: recovery actions are disabled until an administrator explicitly enables them, reducing the risk of unintended service disruption.</p>
<h2>Core Capabilities</h2>
<h3>/nexus-safe status</h3>
<p>This command delivers a real‑time snapshot of system health. It reports key metrics including CPU utilization, RAM usage, disk space, and load averages. The output is formatted for easy reading in a terminal or chat interface, allowing operators to quickly gauge whether the host is operating within normal parameters.</p>
<h3>/nexus-safe logs</h3>
<p>When a service appears misbehaving, operators often need to inspect recent logs before taking any corrective action. The <code>/nexus-safe logs</code> command retrieves diagnostic logs from Docker containers and PM2‑managed Node.js processes. It aggregates the most recent entries, presenting them in a chronological order that helps pinpoint errors, warnings, or anomalous behaviour.</p>
<h3>/nexus-safe recover</h3>
<p>If logs indicate a recoverable fault and the operator has reviewed them within the last five minutes, the <code>/nexus-safe recover</code> command can restart the affected service. The restart is performed only for services that appear in a predefined allowlist, ensuring that critical or unrelated processes are not inadvertently touched.</p>
<h2>Logic &amp; Enforcement</h2>
<p>Nexus‑Safe incorporates several layers of guardrails to prevent abusive or accidental recovery actions.</p>
<h3>Allowlist Required</h3>
<p>The skill references two environment variables: <code>NEXUS_SAFE_ALLOWED_DOCKER</code> and <code>NEXUS_SAFE_ALLOWED_PM2</code>. These variables contain comma‑separated lists of service names that are permitted to be restarted. If a service is not listed, the recover command will refuse to act, logging a denial for audit purposes.</p>
<h3>Logs‑First Policy</h3>
<p>Before any restart is allowed, the skill checks the timestamp of the last log retrieval via <code>/nexus-safe logs</code>. If more than five minutes have passed since the logs were examined, the recover command is blocked. This forces operators to review current state information, reducing the chance of acting on stale data.</p>
<h3>Rate Limiting</h3>
<p>To protect against runaway restart loops, Nexus‑Safe enforces a sliding window rate limit of a maximum of three restarts per hour. Each successful recovery increments a counter; once the threshold is reached, further recover attempts are ignored until the window slides forward.</p>
<h2>Installation Steps</h2>
<p>Getting Nexus‑Safe up and running involves only a few straightforward steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure Python 3.8 or newer is installed on the host.</li>
<li>Install the <code>psutil</code> dependency with <code>pip install psutil</code>. This step requires an active internet connection, but only needs to be performed once.</li>
<li>Verify that <code>docker</code> and <code>pm2</code> binaries are present in the system PATH. You can test this by running <code>docker --version</code> and <code>pm2 --version</code>.</li>
<li>Clone the OpenClaw skills repository or copy the <code>SKILL.md</code> file for Nexus‑Safe into your local skills directory.</li>
<li>Load the skill into your OpenClaw agent according to the agent’s documentation (usually via a configuration file or a dynamic load command).</li>
<li>Optionally set the allowlist environment variables to specify which Docker containers or PM2 processes may be restarted.</li>
<li>Restart the OpenClaw agent to activate the new skill.</li>
</ol>
<p>After installation, you can test the skill by invoking <code>/nexus-safe status</code> in your chat interface. If the command returns a health summary, the skill is correctly loaded and functional.</p>
<h2>Usage Examples</h2>
<h3>Checking System Health</h3>
<p><code>/nexus-safe status</code></p>
<p>Output might look like:</p>
<pre>CPU: 23% | RAM: 4.2GB / 7.8GB (54%) | Disk: 120GB / 500GB (24%) | Load: 0.45, 0.38, 0.30</pre>
<h3>Fetching Recent Logs</h3>
<p><code>/nexus-safe logs</code></p>
<p>The command returns the last 20 lines from each allowed Docker container and PM2 process, clearly labelled with the service name.</p>
<h3>Performing a Controlled Restart</h3>
<p>Assuming you have just reviewed logs for a container named <code>web-app</code> and it is in the allowlist, you can run:</p>
<p><code>/nexus-safe recover</code></p>
<p>The skill will verify the logs‑first condition, check the rate limiter, and then issue a <code>docker restart web-app</code> command. A confirmation message will be posted indicating success or any reason for failure.</p>
<h2>Best Practices for Operating Nexus‑Safe</h2>
<ul>
<li>Define an accurate allowlist. Only include services that are known to be safe to restart automatically.</li>
<li>Regularly rotate the allowlist to reflect changes in your service architecture.</li>
<li>Schedule a periodic manual review of logs even when no incidents are apparent; this keeps the logs‑first timer satisfied and encourages familiarity with normal log patterns.</li>
<li>Monitor the skill’s own logs (if your OpenClaw agent provides them) to ensure that rate limiting or allowlist denials are not unexpectedly blocking needed actions.</li>
<li>Combine Nexus‑Safe with broader observability tools. While it gives quick local insights, integrating with centralized monitoring can provide trend analysis and long‑term capacity planning.</li>
<li>Keep the <code>psutil</code> package up to date to benefit from performance improvements and security patches.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Troubleshooting Common Issues</h2>
<h3>Skill Not Responding</h3>
<p>If slash commands return no response, first confirm that the skill file is correctly placed in the agent’s skills directory and that the agent has been reloaded after installation. Check the agent’s logs for any import errors related to <code>psutil</code>.</p>
<h3>Logs Command Shows No Output</h3>
<p>This can happen if Docker or PM2 are not in the PATH, or if the allowlist variables are empty. Verify that <code>which docker</code> and <code>which pm2</code> return valid paths. Ensure the environment variables are exported before starting the agent.</p>
<h3>Recover Command Is Blocked</h3>
<p>The most common reasons are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logs have not been checked within the last five minutes – run <code>/nexus-safe logs</code> first.</li>
<li>The target service is not present in the allowlist – add it to the appropriate environment variable.</li>
<li>The hourly rate limit has been exceeded – wait for the window to reset or adjust the limit if your operational policy permits.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Nexus‑Safe skill exemplifies how OpenClaw leverages simple, local‑first automation to improve system reliability without compromising privacy or security. By providing clear health diagnostics, enforcing a disciplined logs‑first recovery workflow, and applying robust rate limiting and allowlist controls, Nexus‑Safe empowers operators to act confidently and safely. Its minimal dependency footprint — just <code>psutil</code>, Docker, and PM2 — makes it easy to deploy on a wide range of Linux‑based hosts, from modest edge devices to powerful production servers. For teams seeking a trustworthy, self‑contained tool to keep services healthy while respecting strict data‑privacy constraints, Nexus‑Safe stands out as a ready‑to‑use solution within the OpenClaw ecosystem.</p>
