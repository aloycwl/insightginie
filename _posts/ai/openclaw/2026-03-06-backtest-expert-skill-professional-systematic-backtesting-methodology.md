<h2>What is the Backtest Expert Skill?</h2>
<p>The Backtest Expert skill is a comprehensive systematic approach to backtesting trading strategies based on professional methodology that prioritizes robustness over optimistic results. This skill provides expert guidance for systematic backtesting of trading strategies, covering &#8220;beating ideas to death&#8221; methodology, parameter robustness testing, slippage modeling, bias prevention, and interpreting backtest results.</p>
<p>Unlike typical backtesting approaches that seek to maximize returns, the Backtest Expert skill focuses on finding strategies that &#8220;break the least&#8221; rather than those that &#8220;profit the most&#8221; on paper. This fundamental shift in perspective helps traders develop strategies that are more likely to succeed in live trading conditions.</p>
<h2>Core Philosophy and Principles</h2>
<h3>The Fundamental Goal</h3>
<p>The primary objective of the Backtest Expert skill is to identify trading strategies that can survive harsh conditions and remain profitable under pessimistic assumptions. The principle is simple yet powerful: add friction, stress test assumptions, and see what survives. If a strategy holds up under pessimistic conditions, it&#8217;s more likely to work in live trading.</p>
<h3>When to Use This Skill</h3>
<p>The Backtest Expert skill is essential when:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developing or validating systematic trading strategies</li>
<li>Evaluating whether a trading idea is robust enough for live implementation</li>
<li>Troubleshooting why a backtest might be misleading</li>
<li>Learning proper backtesting methodology</li>
<li>Avoiding common pitfalls like curve-fitting, look-ahead bias, and survivorship bias</li>
<li>Assessing parameter sensitivity and regime dependence</li>
<li>Setting realistic expectations for slippage and execution costs</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Systematic Backtesting Workflow</h2>
<h3>1. State the Hypothesis</h3>
<p>Every successful backtest begins with a clear, concise hypothesis. The skill emphasizes defining the edge in one sentence. For example: &#8220;Stocks that gap up >3% on earnings and pull back to previous day&#8217;s close within first hour provide mean-reversion opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you cannot articulate the edge clearly, the skill recommends not proceeding to testing. This discipline prevents wasted time on vague or poorly-defined strategies.</p>
<h3>2. Codify Rules with Zero Discretion</h3>
<p>The skill requires complete specificity in defining trading rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Entry</strong>: Exact conditions, timing, price type</li>
<li><strong>Exit</strong>: Stop loss, profit target, time-based exit</li>
<li><strong>Position sizing</strong>: Fixed $$, % of portfolio, volatility-adjusted</li>
<li><strong>Filters</strong>: Market cap, volume, sector, volatility conditions</li>
<li><strong>Universe</strong>: What instruments are eligible</li>
</ul>
<p>Critical to this approach is that no subjective judgment is allowed. Every decision must be rule-based and unambiguous. This eliminates the &#8220;I&#8217;ll know it when I see it&#8221; mentality that plagues many trading strategies.</p>
<h3>3. Run Initial Backtest</h3>
<p>The initial backtest should cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimum 5 years (preferably 10+ years)</li>
<li>Multiple market regimes (bull, bear, high/low volatility)</li>
<li>Realistic costs (commissions + conservative slippage)</li>
</ul>
<p>The skill emphasizes examining initial results for basic viability. If the strategy is fundamentally broken, iterate on the hypothesis before proceeding further.</p>
<h3>4. Stress Test the Strategy</h3>
<p>This is where the Backtest Expert skill truly distinguishes itself. The methodology recommends spending 80% of testing time on stress testing. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Parameter sensitivity</strong>: Test stop loss at 50%, 75%, 100%, 125%, 150% of baseline; test profit target at 80%, 90%, 100%, 110%, 120% of baseline; vary entry/exit timing by ±15-30 minutes</li>
<li><strong>Execution friction</strong>: Increase slippage to 1.5-2x typical estimates; model worst-case fills (buy at ask+1 tick, sell at bid-1 tick); add realistic order rejection scenarios; test with pessimistic commission structures</li>
<li><strong>Time robustness</strong>: Analyze year-by-year performance; require positive expectancy in majority of years; ensure strategy doesn&#8217;t rely on 1-2 exceptional periods; test in different market regimes separately</li>
<li><strong>Sample size</strong>: Absolute minimum 30 trades; preferred 100+ trades; high confidence 200+ trades</li>
</ul>
<p>The skill looks for &#8220;plateaus&#8221; of stable performance rather than narrow performance spikes, indicating genuine edge rather than curve-fitting.</p>
<h3>5. Out-of-Sample Validation</h3>
<p>The skill implements walk-forward analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Optimize on training period (e.g., Year 1-3)</li>
<li>Test on validation period (Year 4)</li>
<li>Roll forward and repeat</li>
<li>Compare in-sample vs out-of-sample performance</li>
</ul>
<p>Warning signs include out-of-sample results less than 50% of in-sample performance, need for frequent parameter re-optimization, parameters changing dramatically between periods, or strategy requiring frequent adjustments.</p>
<h3>6. Evaluate Results</h3>
<p>The skill provides a framework for evaluating results through key questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does edge survive pessimistic assumptions?</li>
<li>Is performance stable across parameter variations?</li>
<li>Does strategy work in multiple market regimes?</li>
<li>Is sample size sufficient for statistical confidence?</li>
<li>Are results realistic, not &#8220;too good to be true&#8221;?</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on these evaluations, the skill provides clear decision criteria: deploy if strategy survives all stress tests with acceptable performance, refine if core logic is sound but needs parameter adjustment, or abandon if strategy fails stress tests or relies on fragile assumptions.</p>
<h2>Key Testing Principles</h2>
<h3>Punish the Strategy</h3>
<p>The skill advocates adding friction everywhere:</p>
<ul>
<li>Commissions higher than reality</li>
<li>Slippage 1.5-2x typical estimates</li>
<li>Worst-case fills</li>
<li>Order rejections</li>
<li>Partial fills</li>
</ul>
<p>The rationale is that strategies that survive pessimistic assumptions often outperform in live trading because they&#8217;re built to handle real-world conditions.</p>
<h3>Seek Plateaus, Not Peaks</h3>
<p>The skill emphasizes looking for parameter ranges where performance is stable rather than optimal values that create performance spikes. For example, a good strategy shows profitability with stop loss anywhere from 1.5% to 3.0%, while a bad strategy only works with stop loss at exactly 2.13%. Stable performance indicates genuine edge; narrow optima suggest curve-fitting.</p>
<h3>Test All Cases, Not Cherry-Picked Examples</h3>
<p>The skill warns against the wrong approach of studying hand-picked &#8220;market leaders&#8221; that worked. Instead, it advocates testing every stock that met criteria, including those that failed. Selective examples create survivorship bias and overestimate strategy quality.</p>
<h3>Separate Idea Generation from Validation</h3>
<p>The skill distinguishes between intuition (useful for generating hypotheses) and validation (must be purely data-driven). It emphasizes never letting attachment to an idea influence interpretation of test results.</p>
<h2>Common Failure Patterns</h2>
<p>The skill helps traders recognize failure patterns early to save time:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Parameter sensitivity</strong>: Only works with exact parameter values</li>
<li><strong>Regime-specific</strong>: Great in some years, terrible in others</li>
<li><strong>Slippage sensitivity</strong>: Unprofitable when realistic costs added</li>
<li><strong>Small sample</strong>: Too few trades for statistical confidence</li>
<li><strong>Look-ahead bias</strong>: &#8220;Too good to be true&#8221; results</li>
<li><strong>Over-optimization</strong>: Many parameters, poor out-of-sample results</li>
</ul>
<p>The skill provides detailed documentation of failed tests and diagnostic frameworks to help traders learn from mistakes and avoid repeating them.</p>
<h2>Available Reference Documentation</h2>
<h3>Methodology Reference</h3>
<p>The skill includes comprehensive methodology documentation covering:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stress testing methods</li>
<li>Parameter sensitivity analysis</li>
<li>Slippage and friction modeling</li>
<li>Sample size requirements</li>
<li>Market regime classification</li>
<li>Common biases and pitfalls (survivorship, look-ahead, curve-fitting, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Failed Tests Reference</h3>
<p>The skill maintains a database of failed tests with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why failures are valuable</li>
<li>Common failure patterns with examples</li>
<li>Case study documentation framework</li>
<li>Red flags checklist for evaluating backtests</li>
</ul>
<h2>Critical Reminders</h2>
<p>The skill emphasizes several critical points:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Time allocation</strong>: Spend 20% generating ideas, 80% trying to break them</li>
<li><strong>Context-free requirement</strong>: If strategy requires &#8220;perfect context&#8221; to work, it&#8217;s not robust enough for systematic trading</li>
<li><strong>Red flag</strong>: If backtest results look too good (>90% win rate, minimal drawdowns, perfect timing), audit carefully for look-ahead bias or data issues</li>
<li><strong>Tool limitations</strong>: Understand your backtesting platform&#8217;s quirks (interpolation methods, handling of low liquidity, data alignment issues)</li>
<li><strong>Statistical significance</strong>: Small edges require large sample sizes to prove. 5% edge per trade needs 100+ trades to distinguish from luck</li>
</ul>
<h2>Discretionary vs Systematic Differences</h2>
<p>The skill explicitly focuses on systematic/quantitative backtesting where:</p>
<ul>
<li>All rules are codified in advance</li>
<li>No discretion or &#8220;feel&#8221; in execution</li>
<li>Testing happens on all historical examples, not cherry-picked cases</li>
<li>Context (news, macro) is deliberately stripped out</li>
</ul>
<p>The skill notes that discretionary traders study differently—this methodology may not apply to setups requiring subjective judgment.</p>
<h2>Benefits and Use Cases</h2>
<h3>Benefits for Traders</h3>
<p>The Backtest Expert skill provides numerous benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reduced overfitting</strong>: By stress testing and seeking plateaus rather than peaks, traders avoid curve-fitting to historical data</li>
<li><strong>Improved robustness</strong>: Strategies that survive pessimistic assumptions are more likely to work in live trading</li>
<li><strong>Better risk management</strong>: Understanding parameter sensitivity and regime dependence leads to more resilient strategies</li>
<li><strong>Time efficiency</strong>: Early identification of failure patterns prevents wasting time on unviable strategies</li>
<li><strong>Educational value</strong>: The methodology teaches proper backtesting practices and common pitfalls</li>
<li><strong>Realistic expectations</strong>: By modeling pessimistic scenarios, traders develop more realistic performance expectations</li>
</ul>
<h3>Primary Use Cases</h3>
<p>The skill is particularly valuable for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strategy development</strong>: Creating new trading strategies from scratch with proper validation</li>
<li><strong>Strategy validation</strong>: Testing existing strategies to ensure they&#8217;re robust and not overfit</li>
