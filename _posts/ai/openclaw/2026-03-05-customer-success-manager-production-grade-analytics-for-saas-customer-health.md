<p>Customer Success Manager is a comprehensive analytics solution designed specifically for SaaS businesses to monitor customer health, predict churn risk, and identify expansion opportunities. This production-grade tool provides three Python CLI tools that deliver deterministic, repeatable analysis using only the Python standard library—no external dependencies, API calls, or machine learning models required.</p>
<h2>Core Capabilities</h2>
<p>The Customer Success Manager skill offers three distinct but complementary capabilities that work together to provide a complete view of your customer portfolio health.</p>
<h3>Customer Health Scoring</h3>
<p>The health scoring system evaluates customers across four critical dimensions using weighted scoring models. Each dimension contributes to an overall health score that classifies customers as Red, Yellow, or Green:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Usage (30% weight)</strong>: Measures login frequency, feature adoption rates, and daily active user to monthly active user ratios</li>
<li><strong>Engagement (25% weight)</strong>: Tracks support ticket volume, meeting attendance rates, Net Promoter Score (NPS), and Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) scores</li>
<li><strong>Support (20% weight)</strong>: Monitors open tickets, escalation rates, and average resolution times</li>
<li><strong>Relationship (25% weight)</strong>: Evaluates executive sponsor engagement, multi-threading depth, and renewal sentiment</li>
</ul>
<p>Each customer receives a score between 0-100, with classifications as follows: Green (75-100) indicates healthy customers achieving value, Yellow (50-74) signals customers needing attention, and Red (0-49) identifies at-risk customers requiring immediate intervention.</p>
<h3>Churn Risk Analysis</h3>
<p>The churn risk analyzer identifies at-risk accounts by detecting behavioral signals across five categories with different weightings:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Usage Decline (30% weight)</strong>: Tracks login trends, feature adoption changes, and DAU/MAU changes</li>
<li><strong>Engagement Drop (25% weight)</strong>: Monitors meeting cancellations, response time delays, and NPS changes</li>
<li><strong>Support Issues (20% weight)</strong>: Evaluates open escalations, unresolved critical issues, and satisfaction trends</li>
<li><strong>Relationship Signals (15% weight)</strong>: Detects champion departures, sponsor changes, and competitor mentions</li>
<li><strong>Commercial Factors (10% weight)</strong>: Considers contract types, pricing complaints, and budget cut mentions</li>
</ul>
<p>Risk is classified into four tiers: Critical (80-100) requiring immediate executive escalation, High (60-79) needing urgent CSM intervention, Medium (40-59) calling for proactive outreach, and Low (0-39) suitable for standard monitoring.</p>
<h3>Expansion Opportunity Scoring</h3>
<p>The expansion opportunity scorer identifies upsell, cross-sell, and expansion opportunities through detailed analysis of product usage and organizational potential:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Upsell opportunities</strong>: Customers ready to upgrade to higher tiers or increase usage of existing products</li>
<li><strong>Cross-sell opportunities</strong>: Customers who could benefit from additional product modules</li>
<li><strong>Expansion opportunities</strong>: Customers who could add more seats or involve additional departments</li>
</ul>
<p>The system analyzes current licensed versus active seats, product module adoption rates, and potential departmental expansion to estimate revenue opportunities and prioritize efforts based on impact versus effort.</p>
<h2>Input Requirements and Data Structure</h2>
<p>All three tools accept JSON input files containing customer data. The structure varies slightly depending on the analysis type:</p>
<h3>Health Score Calculator Input</h3>
<p>The health score calculator requires comprehensive customer data including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic customer information (ID, name, segment, ARR)</li>
<li>Usage metrics (login frequency, feature adoption, DAU/MAU ratio)</li>
<li>Engagement metrics (support tickets, meeting attendance, NPS/CSAT)</li>
<li>Support metrics (open tickets, escalation rate, resolution time)</li>
<li>Relationship metrics (executive sponsor engagement, multi-threading depth, renewal sentiment)</li>
<li>Previous period scores for trend analysis</li>
</ul>
<h3>Churn Risk Analyzer Input</h3>
<p>The churn risk analyzer focuses on behavioral and commercial signals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customer information and contract details</li>
<li>Usage decline metrics (login trends, feature adoption changes)</li>
<li>Engagement drop indicators (meeting cancellations, response times)</li>
<li>Support issue data (escalations, critical issues)</li>
<li>Relationship signals (champion changes, competitor mentions)</li>
<li>Commercial factors (contract type, pricing complaints)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Expansion Opportunity Scorer Input</h3>
<p>The expansion scorer requires product usage and organizational structure data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customer and contract information</li>
<li>Product usage data across modules</li>
<li>Adoption rates and usage percentages</li>
<li>Current and potential departments for expansion</li>
<li>Available product tiers and pricing information</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output Formats and Integration</h2>
<p>Each tool supports two output formats for flexibility in how you consume the results:</p>
<h3>Text Format</h3>
<p>The default text format provides human-readable, formatted output ideal for terminal viewing and quick analysis. This format includes clear classifications, risk levels, and actionable insights that CSMs can immediately use.</p>
<h3>JSON Format</h3>
<p>The JSON format provides machine-readable output perfect for integrations with existing systems, automated reporting pipelines, or further analysis in business intelligence tools. This format maintains all the scoring data and classifications in a structured format.</p>
<h2>How to Use: Quick Start and Workflow Integration</h2>
<h3>Quick Start Commands</h3>
<p>Getting started with Customer Success Manager is straightforward:</p>

<h2>Reference Guides and Templates</h2>
<p>The skill includes comprehensive documentation and templates to support your customer success operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Health Scoring Framework</strong>: Complete methodology, dimension definitions, weighting rationale, and threshold calibration guidelines</li>
<li><strong>CSM Playbooks</strong>: Intervention playbooks for each risk tier, onboarding procedures, renewal strategies, expansion approaches, and escalation protocols</li>
<li><strong>CSM Metrics Benchmarks</strong>: Industry benchmarks for Net Revenue Retention (NRR), Gross Revenue Retention (GRR), churn rates, health scores, and expansion rates by segment and industry</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, ready-to-use templates streamline your customer success workflows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>QBR Template</strong>: Quarterly Business Review presentation structure</li>
<li><strong>Success Plan Template</strong>: Customer success plan with goals, milestones, and metrics</li>
<li><strong>Onboarding Checklist</strong>: 90-day onboarding checklist with phase gates</li>
<li><strong>Executive Business Review Template</strong>: Executive stakeholder review for strategic accounts</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Practices for Implementation</h2>
<p>To maximize the value of Customer Success Manager, follow these proven best practices:</p>
<h3>Scoring Frequency</h3>
<p>Establish a regular scoring cadence based on customer segment value:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enterprise customers</strong>: Weekly scoring to maintain close monitoring</li>
<li><strong>Mid-Market customers</strong>: Bi-weekly scoring for balanced oversight</li>
<li><strong>SMB customers</strong>: Monthly scoring for efficient resource allocation</li>
</ul>
<h3>Trend Analysis Focus</h3>
<p>Prioritize trend analysis over static snapshots. A declining Green score often indicates more urgent attention needs than a stable Yellow score. The system&#8217;s ability to compare current scores against previous periods helps identify early warning signs.</p>
<h3>Signal Integration</h3>
<p>Use all three tools together for a comprehensive customer view. Health scoring identifies overall customer status, churn analysis reveals at-risk accounts, and expansion scoring uncovers growth opportunities. This integrated approach prevents blind spots in customer management.</p>
<h3>Threshold Calibration</h3>
<p>While the default thresholds are based on industry standards, calibrate them to your specific business context. Different products, industries, and customer segments may require adjusted benchmarks for optimal accuracy.</p>
<h3>Intervention Documentation</h3>
<p>Document all interventions and their outcomes to continuously refine your playbooks. Track which actions successfully improved customer health, reduced churn risk, or accelerated expansion opportunities.</p>
<h3>Data Preparation</h3>
<p>Always run the analysis tools before important customer meetings, especially Quarterly Business Reviews and executive business reviews. This ensures you have current, data-driven insights to guide strategic discussions.</p>
