<h2>What This OpenClaw Skill Does</h2>
<p>The macOS Notes skill is a powerful automation tool that allows you to create, read, search, and manage Apple Notes on macOS through a simple command-line interface. This skill uses AppleScript and Python to interact with the native Notes.app, making it perfect for users who want to integrate note-taking into their workflows or build voice-controlled assistants.</p>
<h3>Core Functionality</h3>
<p>This skill provides a comprehensive set of commands for managing your Apple Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create notes</strong> &#8211; Jot down ideas, meeting notes, or any information you need to save</li>
<li><strong>Read notes</strong> &#8211; Retrieve and view existing notes by title</li>
<li><strong>Search notes</strong> &#8211; Find notes containing specific text across your accounts</li>
<li><strong>List notes</strong> &#8211; Browse your notes with optional folder and account filtering</li>
<li><strong>Manage folders</strong> &#8211; Discover available accounts and folders in your Notes.app</li>
</ul>
<h3>Key Features and Benefits</h3>
<p>The skill is designed with practical considerations in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Natural language processing</strong> &#8211; Maps conversational requests like &#8220;note this down&#8221; or &#8220;show my notes&#8221; to specific commands</li>
<li><strong>Multi-account support</strong> &#8211; Works with iCloud, On My Mac, and other Notes accounts</li>
<li><strong>HTML/Plain text flexibility</strong> &#8211; Accepts both plain text (converted to HTML) and raw HTML content</li>
<li><strong>Security-conscious</strong> &#8211; Skips password-protected notes and uses JSON input via stdin to avoid command-line exposure</li>
<li><strong>Comprehensive logging</strong> &#8211; All actions are logged with timestamps for audit and debugging</li>
</ul>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>To use this skill effectively, you&#8217;ll need to start by discovering your available folders:</p>
<pre><code>$SKILL_DIR/scripts/notes.sh list-folders
</code></pre>
<p>This command shows you the accounts and folder names available in your Notes.app, which is essential for targeting specific locations when creating or reading notes.</p>
<h3>Usage Examples</h3>
<p>Here are practical examples of how to use the skill:</p>
<p><strong>Create a simple note:</strong></p>
<pre><code>echo '{"title":"Meeting notes","body":"Discussed Q1 roadmap\n- Launch MVP\n- Iterate on feedback"}' | "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/notes.sh" create-note
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Search for specific content:</strong></p>
<pre><code>echo '{"query":"password"}' | "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/notes.sh" search-notes
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Read a specific note:</strong></p>
<pre><code>echo '{"name":"Hinge"}' | "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/notes.sh" read-note
</code></pre>
<h3>Best Practices</h3>
<p>For optimal use of this skill:</p>
<ul>
<li>Always run <code>list-folders</code> first if you&#8217;re unsure about account/folder names</li>
<li>Specify both account and folder when targeting specific locations to avoid ambiguity</li>
<li>Use plain text for body content unless you need rich HTML formatting</li>
<li>Remember that the first line of your body becomes the note title in Notes.app</li>
<li>Be aware that password-protected notes cannot be accessed through this skill</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technical Requirements</h3>
<p>This skill requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>macOS with Notes.app installed</li>
<li>Python 3 for JSON parsing</li>
<li>osascript (AppleScript) for macOS automation</li>
</ul>
