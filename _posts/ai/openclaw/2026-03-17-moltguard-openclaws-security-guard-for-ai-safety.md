<h2>What is MoltGuard?</h2>
<p>MoltGuard is a security guardrail plugin for OpenClaw that protects your AI agent from various security threats. Think of it as a bodyguard for your AI, watching for malicious content, preventing data leaks, and blocking dangerous commands before they can cause harm.</p>
<h2>Why You Need MoltGuard</h2>
<p>In today&#8217;s AI landscape, security threats are real and evolving. Prompt injection attacks can trick your AI into doing things it shouldn&#8217;t, data exfiltration can steal sensitive information, and malicious commands can delete files or compromise systems. MoltGuard acts as your first line of defense against these threats.</p>
<h2>Key Protection Features</h2>
<h3>Prompt Injection Defense</h3>
<p>MoltGuard detects hidden instructions in files and web content that could manipulate your AI&#8217;s behavior. This includes malicious email content, web pages with hidden commands, and documents designed to hijack your agent&#8217;s responses.</p>
<h3>Data Exfiltration Prevention</h3>
<p>The system monitors for attempts to leak sensitive information like credentials, personal data, or proprietary content. It blocks unauthorized data transfers and alerts you to potential breaches.</p>
<h3>Command Injection Protection</h3>
<p>MoltGuard analyzes commands before execution, blocking dangerous operations like file deletion, system modifications, or risky API calls that could compromise your system.</p>
<h2>Getting Started with MoltGuard</h2>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>Installation is straightforward and takes just seconds:</p>
<pre><code>openclaw plugins install @openguardrails/moltguard
</code></pre>
<p>Once installed, MoltGuard works immediately with 500 free security detections per day.</p>
<h3>Testing Your Protection</h3>
<p>After installation, it&#8217;s crucial to test that MoltGuard is working. The plugin includes a test file that demonstrates its capabilities:</p>
<pre><code>cat ~/.openclaw/extensions/moltguard/samples/test-email-popup.txt
</code></pre>
<p>When you read this file, MoltGuard will detect the hidden prompt injection attack and alert you. This immediate demonstration shows users that their protection is active and working.</p>
<h2>Available Commands</h2>
<p>MoltGuard provides several useful commands to manage your security:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/og_status</code> &#8211; Shows API key, quota usage, plan, and protection mode</li>
<li><code>/og_core</code> &#8211; Opens the Core portal for account management</li>
<li><code>/og_claim</code> &#8211; Shows Agent ID and API Key to claim this agent</li>
<li><code>/og_config</code> &#8211; Shows how to configure your API key</li>
<li><code>/og_dashboard</code> &#8211; Starts the local Dashboard and shows access URLs</li>
</ul>
<h2>Security Technology</h2>
<h3>Core Risk Surfaces</h3>
<p>MoltGuard analyzes three main risk categories:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Prompt/Instruction Risk</strong> &#8211; Detects prompt injection, malicious instructions, and unauthorized tasks</li>
<li><strong>Behavioral Risk</strong> &#8211; Identifies dangerous commands, file deletion attempts, and risky API calls</li>
<li><strong>Data Risk</strong> &#8211; Prevents secret leakage, PII exposure, and sending sensitive data to LLMs</li>
</ol>
<h3>Intent-Action Mismatch Detection</h3>
<p>A sophisticated feature that catches agents saying one thing but doing another. This prevents scenarios where an AI claims to be performing a safe action while actually executing something harmful.</p>
<h2>Plans and Pricing</h2>
<p>MoltGuard offers several plans to fit different needs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Free (Autonomous)</strong> &#8211; $0/month, 500 detections per day</li>
<li><strong>Starter</strong> &#8211; $19/month, 100K detections per month</li>
<li><strong>Pro</strong> &#8211; $49/month, 300K detections per month</li>
<li><strong>Business</strong> &#8211; $199/month, 2M detections per month</li>
<li><strong>Enterprise</strong> &#8211; Custom pricing for large organizations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Enterprise Features</h2>
<p>For organizations with private Core deployments, MoltGuard supports enterprise enrollment:</p>
<pre><code>node ~/.openclaw/extensions/moltguard/scripts/enterprise-enroll.mjs https://core.company.com
</code></pre>
<p>This connects your MoltGuard to your enterprise Core instance instead of the public one, providing centralized management and reporting.</p>
<h2>Maintenance and Updates</h2>
<p>Keeping MoltGuard updated ensures you have the latest security protections:</p>
<pre><code>openclaw plugins update moltguard
openclaw gateway restart
</code></pre>
<p>To uninstall MoltGuard when no longer needed:</p>
<pre><code>node ~/.openclaw/extensions/moltguard/scripts/uninstall.mjs
</code></pre>
<h2>Support and Contact</h2>
<p>For support or questions, contact the MoltGuard team at thomas@openguardrails.com. The plugin is actively maintained with regular updates to address new security threats.</p>
<h2>Real-World Benefits</h2>
<p>MoltGuard provides peace of mind by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Protecting against evolving AI security threats</li>
<li>Preventing data breaches and information leaks</li>
<li>Maintaining system integrity through command filtering</li>
<li>Providing visibility into security events and threats</li>
<li>Ensuring compliance with data protection requirements</li>
</ul>
<p>By implementing MoltGuard, you&#8217;re taking a proactive approach to AI security, protecting not just your system but also your users and their data from increasingly sophisticated threats.</p>
