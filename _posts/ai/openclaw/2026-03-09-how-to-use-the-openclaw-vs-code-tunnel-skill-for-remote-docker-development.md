<h1>How to Use the OpenClaw VS Code Tunnel Skill for Remote Docker Development</h1>
<p>In the modern development landscape, the ability to work remotely with Docker containers is becoming increasingly essential. The OpenClaw VS Code Tunnel Skill provides a seamless solution for developers to access remote Docker environments directly from Visual Studio Code. This article will explore what this skill does, how to use it, and its benefits for enhancing your development workflow.</p>
<h2>Understanding the OpenClaw VS Code Tunnel Skill</h2>
<p>The OpenClaw VS Code Tunnel Skill is designed to simplify the process of setting up and managing VS Code Remote Tunnels in Docker container environments. By leveraging this skill, developers can easily connect to their remote containers, gaining full terminal access through VS Code&#8217;s integrated interface.</p>
<h2>Key Features and Functionality</h2>
<h3>1. Trigger Phrases for Convenience</h3>
<p>The skill includes several trigger phrases that make it easy to start, stop, and manage your tunnels. Here are some of the common commands:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;start vscode tunnel&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;open vscode tunnel&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;connect vscode&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;launch code tunnel in container&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;vscode remote&#8221;</li>
<ul>
<p>These phrases can be used to quickly initiate the tunnel process without needing to remember complex command structures.</p>
<h3>2. Commands for Tunnel Management</h3>
<p>The VS Code Tunnel Skill provides a set of commands to manage your tunnels effectively:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start tunnel (interactive name prompt): <code>bash /path/to/tunnel.sh start</code></li>
<li>Start tunnel with specific name: <code>bash /path/to/tunnel.sh start my-tunnel-name</code></li>
<li>Stop tunnel: <code>bash /path/to/tunnel.sh stop</code></li>
<li>View status: <code>bash /path/to/tunnel.sh status</code></li>
<li>View logs: <code>bash /path/to/tunnel.sh log</code></li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Environment Variables for Customization</h3>
<p>Customize your tunnel experience with environment variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>VSCODE_TUNNEL_NAME: Allows you to set a custom name for your tunnel. The default is interactive input.</li>
<li>VSCODE_CLI_DIR: Specifies the directory for the CLI installation, defaulting to <code>~/.vscode-cli</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Usage Examples</h3>
<p>Here are a couple of usage examples to illustrate how to interact with the VS Code Tunnel Skill:</p>
<p><strong>User:</strong> start vscode tunnel</p>
<p><strong>Agent:</strong> Starting VS Code Tunnel&#8230;</p>
<p><code>[Executes: bash tunnel.sh start]</code></p>
<p><strong>Agent:</strong> Tunnel started. Please enter this code in VS Code to authorize: xxxx-xxxx</p>
<p><strong>User:</strong> launch a tunnel named dev-env</p>
<p><strong>Agent:</strong> Starting tunnel dev-env&#8230;</p>
<p><code>[Executes: bash tunnel.sh start dev-env]</code></p>
<h3>5. Dependencies and Notes</h3>
<p>The VS Code Tunnel Skill relies on several dependencies:</p>
<ul>
