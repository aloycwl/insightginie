<h2>Introduction to Threat Modeling</h2>
<p>Threat modeling is a systematic approach to identifying, prioritizing, and mitigating security risks in software systems and applications. This comprehensive framework provides security professionals and developers with the tools needed to design secure systems from the ground up and identify potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.</p>
<h2>When to Use Threat Modeling</h2>
<p>Threat modeling should be employed in several critical scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Designing new systems or features with security-by-design principles</li>
<li>Reviewing existing architecture for security gaps and vulnerabilities</li>
<li>Preparing for security audits and compliance assessments</li>
<li>Identifying potential attack vectors and threat actors</li>
<li>Prioritizing security investments based on risk assessment</li>
<li>Creating comprehensive security documentation</li>
<li>Training development teams on security thinking and secure coding practices</li>
</ul>
<p>However, threat modeling is not appropriate when you lack the scope or authorization for security review, need legal compliance certification (consult legal experts instead), or only require automated scanning (use vulnerability scanners for that purpose).</p>
<h2>The Core Threat Modeling Process</h2>
<p>The threat modeling process follows a structured approach consisting of eight key steps:</p>
<h3>1. Define Scope</h3>
<p>Begin by clearly establishing system boundaries, identifying assets that need protection, defining trust boundaries between components, and understanding regulatory requirements that must be met. This foundational step ensures that the threat modeling exercise remains focused and comprehensive.</p>
<h3>2. Create Data Flow Diagram</h3>
<p>Develop a visual representation of how data moves through your system. A typical data flow diagram might show:</p>
<p>[User] → [Web App] → [API Gateway] → [Backend] → [Database]</p>
<p>↓</p>
<p>[External API]</p>
<p>This diagram helps visualize potential attack surfaces and data exposure points throughout the system architecture.</p>
<h3>3. Identify Assets and Entry Points</h3>
<p>Assets include user data, credentials, business logic, and infrastructure components. Entry points are the various ways attackers could interact with your system, including APIs, forms, file uploads, and admin panels. Understanding both assets and entry points is crucial for comprehensive threat analysis.</p>
<h3>4. Apply STRIDE Methodology</h3>
<p>STRIDE is a mnemonic for six fundamental security threats:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spoofing</strong>: Can someone impersonate a legitimate user or system?</li>
<li><strong>Tampering</strong>: Can data be modified or corrupted?</li>
<li><strong>Repudiation</strong>: Can actions be denied without detection?</li>
<li><strong>Information Disclosure</strong>: Can sensitive data leak or be exposed?</li>
<li><strong>Denial of Service</strong>: Can availability be affected or services disrupted?</li>
<li><strong>Elevation of Privilege</strong>: Can access levels be escalated beyond authorized limits?</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Build Attack Trees</h3>
<p>Attack trees provide a hierarchical representation of potential attack paths. For example, the goal of accessing an admin panel might have multiple attack vectors:</p>
<p>Goal: Access Admin Panel</p>
<p>├── Steal admin credentials</p>
<p>│ ├── Phishing</p>
<p>│ ├── Brute force</p>
<p>│ └── Session hijacking</p>
<p>├── Exploit vulnerability</p>
<p>│ ├── SQL injection</p>
<p>│ └── Auth bypass</p>
<p>└── Social engineering</p>
<p>└── Support desk compromise</p>
<h3>6. Score and Prioritize Threats</h3>
<p>Use established frameworks like DREAD or CVSS to score threats based on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Damage potential</li>
<li>Reproducibility</li>
<li>Exploitability</li>
<li>Affected users</li>
<li>Discoverability</li>
</ul>
<h3>7. Design Mitigations</h3>
<p>Map identified threats to specific security controls and validate that the proposed mitigations adequately address the risks. This step ensures that security measures are both appropriate and effective.</p>
<h3>8. Document Residual Risks</h3>
<p>Clearly document what risks remain after mitigation efforts and provide justification for accepting these residual risks. This transparency is crucial for informed decision-making and risk management.</p>
<h2>STRIDE Analysis Template</h2>
<p>A comprehensive STRIDE analysis should be documented in a table format:</p>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Component</th>
<th>Spoofing</th>
<th>Tampering</th>
<th>Repudiation</th>
<th>Info Disclosure</th>
<th>DoS</th>
<th>EoP</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Web App</td>
<td>Auth bypass</td>
<td>XSS, CSRF</td>
<td>Missing logs</td>
<td>Error messages</td>
<td>Rate limit</td>
<td>Broken access</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>API</td>
<td>Token theft</td>
<td>Input manip</td>
<td>No audit</td>
<td>Data exposure</td>
<td>Resource exhaust</td>
<td>Privilege escalation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Database</td>
<td>Credential theft</td>
<td>SQL injection</td>
<td>No audit trail</td>
<td>Backup exposure</td>
<td>Connection flood</td>
<td>Direct access</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h2>Threat Categories by Layer</h2>
<h3>Application Layer</h3>
<ul>
<li>Injection attacks (SQL, XSS, command injection)</li>
<li>Broken authentication mechanisms</li>
<li>Sensitive data exposure</li>
<li>Broken access control</li>
<li>Security misconfiguration</li>
<li>Using vulnerable components</li>
</ul>
<h3>Network Layer</h3>
<ul>
<li>Man-in-the-middle attacks</li>
<li>Eavesdropping on communications</li>
<li>Replay attacks</li>
<li>DNS spoofing</li>
<li>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Infrastructure Layer</h3>
<ul>
<li>Unauthorized access to systems</li>
<li>Misconfigured services</li>
<li>Unpatched systems</li>
<li>Weak credentials</li>
<li>Exposed admin interfaces</li>
</ul>
<h3>Human Layer</h3>
<ul>
<li>Phishing attacks</li>
<li>Social engineering</li>
<li>Insider threats</li>
<li>Credential sharing</li>
</ul>
<h2>Data Flow Diagram Elements</h2>
<p>Understanding the standard symbols used in data flow diagrams is essential:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>External Entity</strong>: Rectangle &#8211; represents users or external systems</li>
<li><strong>Process</strong>: Circle &#8211; represents application logic and processing</li>
<li><strong>Data Store</strong>: Parallel lines &#8211; represents databases, caches, or files</li>
<li><strong>Data Flow</strong>: Arrow &#8211; represents data movement between components</li>
<li><strong>Trust Boundary</strong>: Dashed line &#8211; represents security perimeter and trust zones</li>
</ul>
<h2>Risk Prioritization Matrix</h2>
<p>Risk prioritization helps focus security efforts on the most critical threats:</p>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>LOW IMPACT</th>
<th>HIGH IMPACT</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>HIGH LIKELIHOOD</td>
<td>MEDIUM</td>
<td>HIGH</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>LOW LIKELIHOOD</td>
<td>LOW</td>
<td>MEDIUM</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h2>DREAD Scoring Framework</h2>
<p>DREAD provides a quantitative approach to risk assessment:</p>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Factor</th>
<th>Question</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Damage</td>
<td>How bad would it be if exploited?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reproducibility</td>
<td>How easy is it to reproduce the attack?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Exploitability</td>
<td>How easy is it to attack?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Affected Users</td>
<td>How many users would be impacted?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Discoverability</td>
<td>How easy is it to find the vulnerability?</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Each factor is scored from 1-10, then averaged to determine the overall risk level.</p>
<h2>Mitigation Strategies</h2>
<h3>Input Validation</h3>
<p>Implement whitelist validation, use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection, encode output to prevent XSS, and enforce proper Content-Type headers.</p>
<h3>Authentication</h3>
<p>Enable multi-factor authentication where possible, enforce strong password policies, implement account lockout mechanisms, and ensure secure session management.</p>
<h3>Authorization</h3>
<p>Follow the principle of least privilege, implement role-based access control, verify resource ownership, and conduct regular permission audits.</p>
<h3>Cryptography</h3>
<p>Use TLS 1.2+ for all communications, implement strong key management practices, use secure password hashing algorithms, and encrypt sensitive data at rest.</p>
<h3>Monitoring</h3>
<p>Implement comprehensive security event logging, deploy anomaly detection systems, establish alert thresholds, and maintain an incident response plan.</p>
<h2>Best Practices</h2>
<p>Successful threat modeling requires adherence to several best practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Involve developers in threat modeling sessions to ensure practical understanding</li>
<li>Focus on data flows rather than just individual components</li>
<li>Consider insider threats alongside external attack vectors</li>
<li>Update threat models as architecture changes occur</li>
<li>Link identified threats to specific security requirements</li>
<li>Track mitigation progress to implementation</li>
<li>Review threat models regularly, not just during initial design</li>
<li>Keep threat models as living documents that evolve with the system</li>
</ul>
