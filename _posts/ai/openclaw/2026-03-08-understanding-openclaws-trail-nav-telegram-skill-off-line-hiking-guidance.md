<h1>Understanding OpenClaw&#8217;s Trail-Nav-Telegram Skill: Off-Line Hiking Guidance</h1>
<p>The <strong>Trail-Nav-Telegram</strong> skill by OpenClaw is an innovative tool designed for hikers who want to navigate their routes efficiently using Telegram. This skill empowers LLM (Language Learning Model) agents to offer offline-capable hiking route guidance through Telegram location messages, ensuring hikers stay on track and safe during their adventures.</p>
<h2>Introduction to Trail-Nav-Telegram</h2>
<p>The primary function of the Trail-Nav-Telegram skill is to provide offline-capable hiking route guidance using Telegram location messages. This is particularly useful when building and operating LLM agent workflows that import GPX/KML routes and answer questions like &#8216;Am I off-route?&#8217; or &#8216;Which way should I go?&#8217; with minimal token usage and fixed outputs.</p>
<h2>Key Features and Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Telegram Integration</strong>: Hikers can send their location and short commands directly through Telegram (iOS), making it a user-friendly interface.</li>
<li><strong>Low-Token Usage</strong>: The skill performs all geometry calculations deterministically, minimizing the use of LLM tokens. This ensures that the LLM is used only for optional wording, keeping the process efficient.</li>
<li><strong>Respect for Access Controls</strong>: The skill respects access controls and does not bypass logins or captchas on external sites, ensuring a secure and reliable experience.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Workflow</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Import Route</strong>: The skill allows users to import a route (GPX/KML) and build a compact RoutePack, which includes a simplified polyline, bounding box, and endpoints.</li>
<li><strong>Bind Route</strong>: Users can bind a route to the chat using the <code>/use <routeId></code> command.</li>
<li><strong>Guide</strong>: By sending their location or using a short command (<code>/g</code> followed by location), users receive a 2-line output that includes machine line and a Chinese template, guiding them along the route.</li>
</ol>
<h2>External Discovery (2bulu)</h2>
<p>The Trail-Nav-Telegram skill supports two modes for external discovery:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Public Discovery (No Login)</strong>: This mode scrapes public list/search pages (e.g., <code>/track/track_search.htm</code> or <code>/track/search-<keyword>.htm</code>) without requiring user login. The data stored includes title, URL, and the time scraped.</li>
<li><strong>Manual-Login Assist (Optional)</strong>: If the user logs in manually (e.g., WeChat/QQ) in a persistent browser profile, automation can proceed within that profile, provided login/captcha steps are completed by the user. The preferred alternative is for the user to export and send the GPX/KML file via Telegram.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Bundle Resources and Scripts</h2>
<p>The Trail-Nav-Telegram skill comes with several bundled resources that enhance its functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scripts</strong>:
<ul>
<li><code>scrape_2bulu_tracks.js</code>: List-page scraper that converts data to JSON/CSV and creates a screenshot.</li>
<li><code>parse_2bulu_kml.js</code>: Parses KML files to generate stats, GeoJSON, and routepack.</li>
<li><code>render_route_map.js</code>: Renders route map into HTML+PNG format for sharing.</li>
<li><code>render_route_map_annotated.js</code>: Renders an annotated map (GeoJSON + alerts) into HTML+PNG.</li>
<li><code>guide_route.js</code>: Provides deterministic off-route guidance from GeoJSON and current location, outputting the 2-4 line guide protocol.</li>
<li><code>weather_alert.js</code>: Offers deterministic weather change alerts (Open-Meteo) for day_hike/summit_camp/trail_run modes.</li>
<li><code>outsideclaw_setup.sh</code>: One-command installation/update of outsideclaw repository into <code>~/.outsideclaw/app/outsideclaw</code>.</li>
<li><code>generate_openclaw_snippet.js</code>: Prints an OpenClaw config snippet pointing to the installed outsideclaw skill.</li>
<li><code>patch_openclaw_config.js</code>: Patches an OpenClaw config JSON to include the installed skill path (creates .bak).</li>
<li><code>openclaw_oneclick_setup.sh</code>: One-click setup for installing outsideclaw, patching config, and optional gateway restart.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h2>Safety Reminders and Reminders</h2>
<p>The Trail-Nav-Telegram skill emphasizes safety during hikes. It provides explicit guidance for no-signal situations and SOS procedures (references/safety-checklist.md). Additionally, it encourages &#8216;hard cutoffs&#8217; for overnight hikes based on time, wind/fog conditions, and hydration levels, helping hikers make informed decisions for a safe and enjoyable experience.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Trail-Nav-Telegram skill by OpenClaw is a powerful tool for hikers looking to navigate their routes efficiently and safely. By integrating with Telegram and using minimal tokens through deterministic calculations, this skill provides offline-capable hiking route guidance. With support for external discovery (2bulu), bundled resources, and a strong emphasis on safety, Trail-Nav-Telegram is an invaluable addition to any LLM agent workflow for hiking enthusiasts.</p>
