<p>The Codex Orchestrator skill is a powerful tool designed to manage and supervise background Codex coding sessions. This skill provides a comprehensive workflow for launching, monitoring, controlling, and reporting on long-running coding tasks, making it essential for developers who need to orchestrate complex AI-assisted development processes.</p>
<h2>How the Codex Orchestrator Works</h2>
<p>The skill follows a four-phase workflow that ensures your coding tasks run smoothly from start to finish. First, it launches Codex in a background PTY session, which maintains interactivity without blocking your main agent. This is crucial because it allows you to continue working while Codex handles the heavy lifting in the background.</p>
<p>During the launch phase, the skill executes a command like <code>codex exec --full-auto '&lt;PROMPT&gt;'</code> in the target directory and stores the returned session ID. This session ID becomes your key to monitoring and controlling the process later.</p>
<h2>Monitoring Background Sessions</h2>
<p>The monitoring phase is where the Codex Orchestrator truly shines. It regularly checks the progress of your background session, looking for signs of life such as spinner animations, progress bars, or file edits. The skill can retrieve the last 2KB of logs to show you exactly what&#8217;s happening in real-time.</p>
<p>Understanding when Codex is working versus when it&#8217;s stuck is critical. Signs of life include messages like &#8220;Working&#8230;&#8221;, &#8220;Thinking&#8230;&#8221;, or &#8220;Running&#8230;&#8221;, along with actual file modifications. However, if you see interactive prompts asking for directory selections or approval for changes, or if there&#8217;s no log output for more than five minutes, the process might be blocked or hung.</p>
<h2>Taking Control When Needed</h2>
<p>The intervention phase gives you powerful control over stuck sessions. If Codex is waiting at a prompt, you can automatically send responses like &#8216;y&#8217; or just press Enter to continue. This eliminates the need to manually intervene in every interactive session.</p>
<p>For more serious issues like looping or hallucination, the skill allows you to kill the session entirely and restart it. This ensures that problematic sessions don&#8217;t waste resources or cause further complications in your development workflow.</p>
<h2>Reporting and Completion</h2>
<p>Once a significant milestone is reached or the task completes, the Codex Orchestrator provides comprehensive reporting. It summarizes the work done, including which files were changed and whether tests passed, then notifies you of the results. This keeps you informed without requiring constant manual checking.</p>
<h2>Standard Operating Procedures</h2>
<p>The skill includes built-in protocols for common scenarios. The &#8220;Stuck Agent&#8221; protocol helps diagnose issues by examining recent logs, analyzing whether Codex is asking questions or downloading files, and taking appropriate action. If Codex is asking something, you provide the answer; if it&#8217;s downloading slowly, you wait; if it&#8217;s silent for too long, you can send a poke or restart the session.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Resume&#8221; protocol handles session recovery, allowing you to restart a session that died or was killed using <code>codex resume --last</code> or by specifying the session ID. This ensures continuity even when unexpected interruptions occur.</p>
<h2>Managing Logs and Artifacts</h2>
<p>Since Codex logs are ephemeral in the PTY buffer, the skill provides mechanisms for persistent logging. You can instruct Codex to write to a file using commands like <code>codex exec "task..." &gt; codex.log 2&gt;&amp;1</code>, though be aware that buffering may delay output. A better approach is using the skill&#8217;s log snapshot feature to periodically capture the buffer state.</p>
<h2>Why This Skill Matters</h2>
<p>The Codex Orchestrator skill transforms how developers work with AI coding assistants. Instead of babysitting long-running tasks or dealing with unexpected prompts, you can set up complex workflows and let the skill handle the orchestration. This is particularly valuable for tasks like large-scale refactoring, comprehensive testing, or multi-file code generation where manual oversight would be impractical.</p>
<p>By providing this level of automation and control, the Codex Orchestrator skill enables developers to leverage AI coding assistance more effectively, focusing on higher-level design decisions while the skill manages the execution details. It&#8217;s an essential tool for anyone looking to integrate AI coding agents into their development workflow at scale.</p>
