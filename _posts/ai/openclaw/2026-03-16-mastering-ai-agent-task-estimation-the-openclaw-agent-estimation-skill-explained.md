<h1>Mastering AI Agent Task Estimation: The OpenClaw Agent-Estimation Skill Explained</h1>
<p>In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, one of the most challenging tasks for AI coding agents is accurately estimating the duration and complexity of coding tasks. OpenClaw&#8217;s agent-estimation skill addresses this issue head-on, providing a structured methodology for AI agents to estimate work effort based on their own operational efficiencies rather than relying on human developer timelines. This blog post will delve into what the agent-estimation skill is, how it works, its key components, and why it is a game-changer for AI-driven coding tasks.</p>
<h2>Introduction to the Agent-Estimation Skill</h2>
<p>The agent-estimation skill is a cutting-edge tool designed to help AI agents precisely estimate the effort required for coding tasks without the bias of human timelines. Traditional estimation methods often anchor to human developer experiences, leading to significant overestimations. For instance, a task that an AI agent can complete in 30 minutes might be estimated as taking &#8216;2-3 days&#8217; based on what a human developer forum post would suggest. This discrepancy can lead to inefficient planning and resource allocation.</p>
<h2>The Problem with Traditional Estimation Methods</h2>
<p>The problem lies in the fundamental difference between how humans and AI agents perceive and execute tasks. Human developers often rely on past experiences, contextual understanding, and a deep knowledge of frameworks and libraries, which can lead to longer development times. On the other hand, AI agents operate at a much faster pace, iterating quickly through cycles of reasoning, coding, execution, verification, and fixing errors. When AI agents use human-based estimation frameworks, they tend to overestimate the time required, leading to inefficiencies.</p>
<h2>The Solution: Agent-Estimation Skill</h2>
<p>The agent-estimation skill provides a solution by forcing AI agents to estimate their operational units, known as &#8216;tool-call rounds.&#8217; These rounds represent the atomic units of an AI agent&#8217;s workflow, consisting of one complete iteration of reasoning, coding, executing, verifying, and fixing. By focusing on these operational units, AI agents can provide more accurate and contextually relevant estimates, which can then be converted into human wallclock time at the end of the estimation process.</p>
<h2>Core Units of the Agent-Estimation Skill</h2>
<h3>Round</h3>
<p>A &#8217;round&#8217; is the basic unit of the agent-estimation skill. It corresponds to one complete cycle of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Agent reasoning about what to do</li>
<li>Agent writing or editing code</li>
<li>Agent running the code or a test</li>
<li>Agent reading the output</li>
<li>Agent deciding if it needs to fix something (if yes, move to the next round)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each round typically takes around 2-4 minutes of wallclock time.</p>
<h3>Module</h3>
<p>A &#8216;module&#8217; is a functional unit built from multiple rounds until it is usable. Modules are independently buildable and testable components of a larger project. The number of rounds required to complete a module can vary widely depending on the complexity and familiarity of the task.</p>
<h3>Project</h3>
<p>A &#8216;project&#8217; encompasses all modules, along with integration and debugging efforts. The total project rounds are the sum of the effective rounds of all modules, multiplied by an integration factor to account for the additional effort required to integrate and debug the modules together.</p>
<h2>The Estimation Procedure</h2>
<p>When asked to estimate a task, the agent-estimation skill follows a structured procedure to break down the task, estimate the effort required, and convert it into wallclock time.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Decompose into Modules</h3>
<p>The first step is to decompose the task into functional modules. Each module should be independently buildable and testable, allowing the AI agent to focus on one component at a time. This modular approach helps in managing complexity and ensures that each part of the task is well understood before moving on to the next.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Estimate Rounds per Module</h3>
<p>For each module, the AI agent estimates the number of rounds required based on predefined patterns and anchors. These anchors help in calibrating the estimation based on the complexity and familiarity of the task:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Boilerplate / Known Pattern (1-2 rounds)</strong>: Examples include CRUD endpoints, configuration files, and standard API clients.</li>
<li><strong>Moderate Complexity (3-5 rounds)</strong>: Examples include custom UI layouts, state management, and data pipelines.</li>
<li><strong>Exploratory / Under-Documented (5-10 rounds)</strong>: Examples include unfamiliar frameworks, platform-specific APIs, and complex integrations.</li>
<li><strong>High Uncertainty (8-15 rounds)</strong>: Examples include undocumented behaviors, novel algorithms, and multi-system debugging.</li>
</ul>
<p>Key calibration rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you can generate the code in one shot and it will likely run → 1 round</li>
<li>If you&#8217;ll need to generate, run, see an error, and fix → 2-3 rounds</li>
<li>If the library/framework has sparse docs and you&#8217;ll be guessing → 5+ rounds</li>
<li>If it involves platform permissions, OS-level APIs, or environment-specific behavior the user must manually verify → add 2-3 rounds</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 3: Assign Risk Coefficients</h3>
<p>Each module is assigned a risk coefficient that inflates its round count based on the perceived risk and uncertainty associated with the task. The risk levels and their corresponding coefficients are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Low Risk (1.0)</strong>: Mature ecosystem, clear docs, agent has strong pattern match</li>
<li><strong>Medium Risk (1.3)</strong>: Minor unknowns, may need 1-2 extra debug rounds</li>
<li><strong>High Risk (1.5)</strong>: Sparse docs, platform quirks, integration unknowns</li>
<li><strong>Very High Risk (2.0)</strong>: Possible dead ends, may need to change approach entirely</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 4: Calculate Totals</h3>
<p>The total project rounds are calculated by summing the effective rounds of all modules and adding integration rounds. The integration rounds account for the additional effort required to wire the modules together and typically range from 10-20% of the base total.</p>
<h3>Step 5: Convert to Wallclock Time</h3>
<p>The final step is to convert the total project rounds into human wallclock time. The default conversion rate is 3 minutes per round, which includes both agent generation time and user review time. This rate can be adjusted based on the context:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fast iteration, user barely reviews:</strong> 2 min/round</li>
<li><strong>Complex domain, user carefully reviews each step:</strong> 4 min/round</li>
<li><strong>User needs to manually test (mobile, hardware, permissions):** 5 min/round</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output Format</h2>
<p>The agent-estimation skill outputs the estimation in a structured format that includes a module breakdown, summary, and biggest risks. This format ensures clarity and consistency, making it easy for users to understand the estimation and plan accordingly.</p>
<h3>Module Breakdown</h3>
<p>The module breakdown section lists each module, along with the base rounds, risk coefficient, effective rounds, and notes. This detailed breakdown helps users understand the estimation process and identify areas of potential risk.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The summary section provides a high-level overview of the estimation, including the base rounds, integration rounds, risk-adjusted total, and estimated wallclock time. This summary helps users quickly grasp the key details of the estimation.</p>
<h3>Biggest Risks</h3>
<p>The biggest risks section lists the top risks and potential issues that could impact the estimation. This section helps users anticipate and plan for potential challenges, ensuring a smoother project execution.</p>
<h2>Anti-Patterns to Avoid</h2>
<p>The agent-estimation skill is designed to prevent common failure modes in estimation, such as human-time anchoring, padding by vibes, confusing complexity with volume, forgetting integration cost, and ignoring user-side bottlenecks. By focusing on operational units and using a structured methodology, the skill helps AI agents provide accurate and reliable estimates.</p>
<h3>Human-Time Anchoring</h3>
<p>Avoid basing estimates on human developer timelines. Instead, start from the AI agent&#8217;s operational units (tool-call rounds) to provide contextually relevant estimates.</p>
<h3>Padding by Vibes</h3>
<p>Avoid adding time &#8216;just to be safe&#8217; without specific risk rationale. Use risk coefficients to account for uncertainty and potential issues.</p>
<h3>Confusing Complexity with Volume</h3>
<p>Avoid equating the volume of code (e.g., 500 lines of boilerplate) with complexity. Focus on the uncertainty and unfamiliarity of the task to provide accurate estimates.</p>
<h3>Forgetting Integration Cost</h3>
<p>Always account for the additional effort required to integrate and debug modules together. Add integration rounds to the base total to ensure a complete estimation.</p>
<h3>Ignoring User-Side Bottlenecks</h3>
<p>Consider the user&#8217;s role in the project, such as manual permission grants, app restarts, or device testing. Adjust the minutes per round to reflect the user&#8217;s involvement rather than adding phantom rounds.</p>
<h2>Calibration Reference</h2>
<p>The agent-estimation skill includes a calibration reference with example projects and known round counts to help users calibrate their estimates. This reference provides detailed examples across different project types, ensuring consistency and accuracy in estimation.</p>
<h2>Eval Prompts</h2>
