<h2>Introduction to Venice-API-Kit</h2>
<p>The Venice-API-Kit is a comprehensive toolkit designed for the entire Venice AI API ecosystem. This OpenClaw skill provides developers and creators with a complete set of tools for working with Venice&#8217;s powerful AI models, covering everything from image generation to video creation, audio processing, and administrative functions. Built with privacy in mind, the toolkit ensures zero data retention while providing access to cutting-edge AI capabilities.</p>
<h2>Getting Started with Venice-API-Kit</h2>
<p>Before diving into the toolkit&#8217;s features, you&#8217;ll need to set up your environment. The Venice-API-Kit requires a Venice AI API key, which you can obtain by visiting venice.ai and navigating to Settings &rarr; API Keys.</p>
<h3>Installation Options</h3>
<p>The toolkit offers multiple installation methods to suit your workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Using uv package manager:</strong> The recommended approach for modern Python development</li>
<li><strong>Using Python 3.12:</strong> For those who prefer system-level Python installation</li>
<li><strong>Manual installation:</strong> Installing httpx via pip for HTTP requests</li>
</ul>
<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>Once you have your API key, you can configure the toolkit in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set the environment variable: <code>export VENICE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"</code></li>
<li>Configure in <code>~/.openclaw/openclaw.json</code> with your API key</li>
</ol>
<h2>Core Features of Venice-API-Kit</h2>
<h3>Image Generation</h3>
<p>The toolkit&#8217;s image generation capabilities are powered by Venice&#8217;s advanced image models. You can create stunning visuals by providing text prompts that describe what you want to generate. The system supports various models, sizes, and styles to match your creative vision.</p>
<p>To generate an image, you can use the following command structure:</p>
<pre><code>uv run {baseDir}/scripts/image_generate.py --prompt "a serene mountain landscape at sunset"
</code></pre>
<p>The toolkit offers extensive customization options including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple model choices (with <code>flux-2-max</code> as default)</li>
<li>Various image sizes from 1024&#215;1024 to 1792&#215;1024</li>
<li>Style presets for different artistic effects</li>
<li>Negative prompts to exclude unwanted elements</li>
<li>Seed values for reproducible results</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also explore available styles using the <code>--list-styles</code> flag to discover different artistic presets.</p>
<h3>Image Upscaling</h3>
<p>The toolkit includes powerful upscaling capabilities that can enhance your images 1-4x while preserving or enhancing details. This feature is particularly useful for improving the quality of generated images or enlarging existing photos.</p>
<p>Basic upscaling is straightforward:</p>
<pre><code>uv run {baseDir}/scripts/image_upscale.py --image input.png --scale 2
</code></pre>
<p>For more creative control, you can enable AI enhancement with options like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enhancement:</strong> Enable AI-powered detail improvement</li>
<li><strong>Creativity control:</strong> Adjust how much the AI can modify the original (0-1 scale)</li>
<li><strong>Style application:</strong> Apply specific styles like &#8220;cinematic lighting&#8221; or &#8220;gold&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Replication:</strong> Control how much the AI preserves original elements</li>
</ul>
<h3>Image Editing</h3>
<p>The image editing feature allows you to modify existing images using text-based instructions. This powerful capability lets you make complex edits without technical image editing skills.</p>
<p>Basic editing works like this:</p>
<pre><code>uv run {baseDir}/scripts/image_edit.py --image photo.png --prompt "add sunglasses"
</code></pre>
<p>You can choose from different edit models depending on your needs, and control the output aspect ratio to match your requirements.</p>
<h3>Background Removal</h3>
<p>Removing backgrounds from images is made simple with the toolkit&#8217;s dedicated background removal feature. This is particularly useful for creating product images, marketing materials, or preparing images for further editing.</p>
<p>Usage is straightforward:</p>
<pre><code>uv run {baseDir}/scripts/image_background_remove.py --image photo.png
</code></pre>
<h3>Text-to-Speech</h3>
<p>The toolkit&#8217;s text-to-speech capabilities offer a wide range of voices and formats for converting text into natural-sounding audio. With support for multiple languages and voice types, you can create voiceovers, audiobooks, or any audio content you need.</p>
<p>Basic usage:</p>
<pre><code>uv run {baseDir}/scripts/audio_speech.py --text "Hello, welcome to Venice AI"
</code></pre>
<p>The toolkit provides extensive voice options including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>American voices:</strong> Multiple female and male options</li>
<li><strong>British voices:</strong> Female and male variants</li>
<li><strong>Customization:</strong> Speed control, format selection, and streaming options</li>
</ul>
<h3>Audio Transcription</h3>
<p>Using Whisper-based technology, the toolkit can transcribe audio files into text with high accuracy. This feature supports multiple audio formats and languages, making it versatile for various use cases.</p>
<p>Basic transcription:</p>
<pre><code>uv run {baseDir}/scripts/transcribe.py --file audio.mp3
</code></pre>
<p>Advanced options include timestamp inclusion, language specification, and different output formats.</p>
<h3>Embeddings</h3>
<p>For developers building RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) applications or semantic search features, the toolkit provides embedding generation capabilities. These vector representations of text enable powerful similarity searches and content organization.</p>
<p>Creating embeddings:</p>
<pre><code>uv run {baseDir}/scripts/embeddings.py --text "Your text to embed"
</code></pre>
<h3>Video Generation</h3>
<p>The toolkit&#8217;s video generation capabilities allow you to create short videos from text prompts or transform images into videos. This feature supports multiple models and resolutions, with some requiring reference images for optimal results.</p>
<p>Text-to-video generation:</p>
<pre><code>uv run {baseDir}/scripts/video_generate.py --prompt "a cat playing piano"
</code></pre>
<p>Image-to-video generation:</p>
<pre><code>uv run {baseDir}/scripts/video_generate.py --prompt "a cat playing piano" --image reference.png
</code></pre>
<p>Options include duration control, resolution settings, aspect ratio adjustment, and negative prompts.</p>
<h3>Models Explorer</h3>
<p>The toolkit includes a comprehensive models explorer that lets you browse and discover all available Venice AI models. This tool is invaluable for understanding what capabilities are available and choosing the right model for your needs.</p>
<p>Basic model listing:</p>
<pre><code>uv run {baseDir}/scripts/models.py
</code></pre>
<p>You can filter by model type (text, image, video, etc.) and choose different output formats for easy integration with other tools.</p>
<h3>Characters Browser</h3>
<p>Venice AI offers character personas that can be used for various applications. The toolkit&#8217;s characters browser allows you to explore and discover these personas, complete with search and filtering capabilities.</p>
<p>Browsing characters:</p>
<pre><code>uv run {baseDir}/scripts/characters.py
</code></pre>
<p>You can search by name, filter by tags, and control the number of results returned.</p>
<h3>Admin Functions</h3>
<p>For users who need to manage their Venice AI usage, the toolkit includes administrative functions. The balance checking feature allows you to monitor your DIEM and USD balances, ensuring you stay within your usage limits.</p>
<p>Checking balance:</p>
<pre><code>uv run {baseDir}/scripts/balance.py
</code></pre>
<p>Note that this feature requires an admin API key for access.</p>
