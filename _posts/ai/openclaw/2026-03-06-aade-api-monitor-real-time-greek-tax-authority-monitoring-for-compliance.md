<h2>What is AADE API Monitor?</h2>
<p>AADE API Monitor is a specialized OpenClaw skill designed to provide comprehensive real-time monitoring of Greek tax authority systems. This professional-grade tool tracks AADE (Independent Authority for Public Revenue) announcements, deadline changes, rate modifications, and system status updates through intelligent file processing and government website monitoring.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional API-based monitoring solutions, AADE API Monitor leverages OpenClaw&#8217;s file-first processing architecture to deliver reliable, offline-capable monitoring of government documents and announcements. The skill processes Greek language documents, extracts critical compliance information, and generates professional alerts for accounting teams and businesses.</p>
<h2>Core Features and Capabilities</h2>
<h3>Real-Time Government Monitoring</h3>
<p>The skill continuously monitors multiple Greek government sources including:</p>
<ul>
<li>AADE main website for announcements, circulars, and deadlines</li>
<li>TAXISnet system status and maintenance schedules</li>
<li>myDATA API status and technical announcements</li>
<li>Press releases and legal database updates</li>
</ul>
<p>Monitoring occurs at strategic intervals &#8211; every 2 hours for primary AADE sources, hourly for myDATA status, and daily for legal updates. This ensures businesses receive timely notifications about critical changes affecting their tax compliance obligations.</p>
<h3>Intelligent Document Processing</h3>
<p>AADE API Monitor employs a sophisticated six-step processing pipeline:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Download</strong>: Fetches government documents in PDF, HTML, and XML formats</li>
<li><strong>Extract</strong>: Uses deepread OCR to extract Greek text content</li>
<li><strong>Classify</strong>: Identifies deadline changes, rate updates, and system notifications</li>
<li><strong>Compare</strong>: Detects changes by comparing with cached data</li>
<li><strong>Validate</strong>: Cross-references multiple sources for accuracy</li>
<li><strong>Generate</strong>: Creates alerts, reports, and notifications</li>
</ol>
<p>The system supports Greek character encoding including UTF-8, Windows-1253, and ISO-8859-7, ensuring accurate processing of all government documents regardless of format.</p>
<h3>Professional Alert System</h3>
<p>AADE API Monitor features a three-tier alert classification system:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Critical Alerts</strong>: Immediate notifications for deadline changes and system outages</li>
<li><strong>Important Alerts</strong>: Email and dashboard updates for rate changes and new regulations</li>
<li><strong>Routine Alerts</strong>: Weekly summaries for scheduled maintenance</li>
</ul>
<p>Alerts are delivered through multiple channels including Slack, SMS, and local file storage, with professional Greek-language templates for client communications.</p>
