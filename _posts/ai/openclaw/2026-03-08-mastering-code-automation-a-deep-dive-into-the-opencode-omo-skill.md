<h1>Introduction to OpenCode OMO</h1>
<p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of software development, the quest for efficiency is never-ending. Developers are constantly seeking ways to bridge the gap between intent and execution. Enter the <strong>OpenCode OMO (Oh-My-OpenCode)</strong> skill, a specialized tool within the OpenClaw ecosystem designed to revolutionize how we approach coding tasks. By leveraging specialized agents—Prometheus, Atlas, and Sisyphus—this skill transforms chaotic development requests into structured, completed work.</p>
<h2>The Philosophy Behind OMO</h2>
<p>The core philosophy of OMO is to replace ad-hoc, error-prone coding with a rigorous, repeatable, and automated methodology. It acts as an operating guide, ensuring that every piece of code generated follows a specific, optimized workflow. Whether you are dealing with a simple script or a complex architecture, OMO provides the scaffolding necessary to maintain high standards of code quality.</p>
<h3>The Holy Trinity of Agents</h3>
<p>At the heart of this skill lie three distinct agents, each with a specialized role:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prometheus (Planning):</strong> Before any code is written, Prometheus steps in to map out the task. By using the @plan directive, developers can generate a comprehensive roadmap, ensuring all requirements are understood and potential pitfalls are identified early.</li>
<li><strong>Atlas (Execution):</strong> Once a plan is validated, Atlas takes the helm. Through the /start-work command, Atlas executes the plan with surgical precision, minimizing the need for manual intervention and ensuring the code adheres to the defined roadmap.</li>
<li><strong>Sisyphus (Iteration and Management):</strong> Sisyphus serves as the engine of the workflow. It manages the iterative process, ensuring that the development lifecycle remains consistent and that improvements are applied systematically across runs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Getting Started with OpenCode OMO</h2>
<p>Integrating OMO into your workflow is straightforward. Before diving in, you need to verify your environment. Open your terminal and run <code>cat ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json | grep "oh-my-opencode"</code>. If you receive an output, you are ready to proceed. If not, the provided <code>./scripts/check-omo.sh</code> script can help you confirm the installation status.</p>
<h3>One-Shot Delivery: The ULW Advantage</h3>
<p>For smaller, focused tasks, OMO offers a &#8220;one-shot&#8221; execution method using <code>ulw</code> (UltraWork). Instead of a lengthy planning session, you can run <code>opencode run --agent sisyphus "implement JWT auth in this service and add tests"</code>. This triggers an immediate, focused effort to deliver the requested feature, complete with unit tests. It is the perfect solution for feature requests that do not require complex architectural shifts.</p>
<h2>The Workflow: Plan, Execute, Iterate</h2>
<p>For larger projects, the interactive mode is highly recommended. By launching <code>opencode --agent sisyphus</code>, you enter a state where you can invoke the full power of the toolkit. The workflow is simple yet powerful: 1. You present your requirement. 2. You use <code>@plan</code> to generate the structural approach with Prometheus. 3. You initiate the transformation with <code>/start-work</code>. If the agent requires further clarification, simply iterate in the plan mode, refining the scope until both the developer and the agent are aligned.</p>
<h3>Rules for Success</h3>
<p>To get the most out of the OMO skill, users must adhere to a set of core rules: Always prefer Sisyphus-first execution for coding tasks. Do not attempt to manually edit code outside of the OpenCode environment unless explicitly necessary. This ensures that the &#8220;state&#8221; of the project remains synchronized with the automated agents, preventing conflicts and drift in code quality.</p>
<h2>Handling Failures and Improving Determinism</h2>
<p>No development tool is immune to ambiguity. If the agent asks clarifying questions, do not treat this as a failure, but as a feature. Use this opportunity to refine the plan in Prometheus mode. For tasks requiring higher levels of determinism, break your request into smaller, explicit units and process them using <code>ulw</code>. Smaller requests inherently lead to higher accuracy and less room for misinterpretation.</p>
<h2>Ecosystem Integration</h2>
<p>The beauty of the OpenCode OMO skill is its interoperability. It is designed to work in tandem with other OpenClaw skills:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Agent-Selfie:</strong> Pair your structured coding workflows with generated documentation or visual assets to keep stakeholders informed.</li>
<li><strong>Gemini-Image-Gen:</strong> Apply the same rigorous OMO workflow discipline to image generation automations, ensuring your assets are as consistent as your code.</li>
<li><strong>Agentgram:</strong> Use this to publish progress updates and findings automatically as your agents complete their milestones.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The OpenCode OMO skill represents a major step forward for developers looking to scale their capabilities. By automating the planning, execution, and iteration phases of software development, it allows engineers to focus on high-level architecture rather than repetitive implementation tasks. As version 0.3.0 brings even tighter integration and better helper scripts, there has never been a better time to adopt this framework. Whether you are a solo developer or part of a larger team, implementing OMO will undoubtedly lead to cleaner code, faster delivery times, and a significantly more organized development process.</p>
<p>Embrace the power of the triad—Prometheus, Atlas, and Sisyphus—and watch as your coding productivity reaches new heights. Happy coding!</p>
