<h2>What is AgentShield Audit?</h2>
<p>AgentShield Audit is a comprehensive privacy-first security assessment skill designed specifically for AI agents and their infrastructure. It provides a robust framework for evaluating agent security, detecting vulnerabilities, and establishing trust through a public certificate system—all while ensuring zero data leakage from your environment.</p>
<p>This skill performs 52+ security tests locally within your agent&#8217;s environment, generating cryptographic certificates and trust scores without ever exposing your sensitive data, prompts, or agent behavior to external systems.</p>
<h2>How AgentShield Audit Works</h2>
<p>The skill operates through a sophisticated privacy-first architecture that ensures complete data isolation while providing comprehensive security assessment.</p>
<h3>Privacy-First Architecture</h3>
<p>AgentShield Audit&#8217;s core principle is that no sensitive data ever leaves your system. The entire assessment runs locally within your agent&#8217;s environment through a dedicated subagent process.</p>
<p>The workflow follows this secure path:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local Testing:</strong> All 52+ security tests execute within your agent&#8217;s session</li>
<li><strong>Ed25519 Key Generation:</strong> Cryptographic keys are generated and stored locally</li>
<li><strong>Challenge-Response Protocol:</strong> Identity verification happens through cryptographic signatures</li>
<li><strong>Certificate Issuance:</strong> Only public keys and trust scores are shared externally</li>
</ul>
<h3>Security Test Categories</h3>
<p>The skill conducts comprehensive testing across five major categories:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Input Sanitizer:</strong> Detects prompt injection, SQL injection, XSS vulnerabilities, and command injection attempts</li>
<li><strong>EchoLeak Test:</strong> Identifies zero-click data exfiltration and context contamination risks</li>
<li><strong>Tool Sandbox:</strong> Tests permission boundaries, filesystem access, and network isolation</li>
<li><strong>Output DLP:</strong> Detects PII, API keys, and secret leakage in outputs</li>
<li><strong>Supply Chain Scanner:</strong> Verifies dependency integrity and package vulnerabilities</li>
</ol>
<h3>Certificate System</h3>
<p>AgentShield Audit uses Ed25519 digital signatures to create verifiable certificates. Each assessment generates a unique certificate that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Public key hash for registry lookup</li>
<li>Challenge-response signature for identity verification</li>
<li>Timestamp for audit trail</li>
</ul>
<p>These certificates are stored in a public trust registry, allowing anyone to verify an agent&#8217;s security status without accessing sensitive information.</p>
<h2>Trust Score System</h2>
<p>The skill implements a comprehensive trust scoring system that evaluates agents on a scale of 0-100, categorizing them into four tiers:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>🔴 UNVERIFIED (0):</strong> No certificate issued</li>
<li><strong>🟡 BASIC (1-49):</strong> Initial assessment completed</li>
<li><strong>🟢 VERIFIED (50-79):</strong> Multiple successful verifications</li>
<li><strong>🔵 TRUSTED (80-100):</strong> Proven track record of security</li>
</ol>
<p>Trust scores are calculated using a weighted formula:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>40%:</strong> Verification count (consistency)</li>
<li><strong>30%:</strong> Certificate age (reputation)</li>
<li><strong>30%:</strong> Assessment success rate (reliability)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Key Benefits and Use Cases</h2>
<h3>Security Benefits</h3>
<p><strong>Zero Data Leakage:</strong> All tests run locally, ensuring no sensitive information leaves your environment. This is particularly crucial for organizations handling proprietary code, confidential conversations, or regulated data.</p>
<p><strong>Comprehensive Vulnerability Detection:</strong> The 52+ tests cover a wide range of security concerns, from basic input validation to sophisticated supply chain attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Compliance Ready:</strong> AgentShield Audit is designed with regulatory compliance in mind, supporting GDPR, EU AI Act, and other frameworks.</p>
<h3>Operational Benefits</h3>
<p><strong>Automated Security Assessment:</strong> The skill can be triggered automatically or run on-demand, providing continuous security monitoring without manual intervention.</p>
<p><strong>Trust Building:</strong> The public registry and trust scoring system help establish credibility with users, partners, and regulators.</p>
<p><strong>Risk Mitigation:</strong> Early detection of vulnerabilities prevents potential security incidents and data breaches.</p>
<h3>Specific Use Cases</h3>
<p><strong>Enterprise AI Deployment:</strong> Organizations deploying AI agents can use AgentShield Audit to ensure their agents meet security standards before production deployment.</p>
<p><strong>AI Agent Marketplaces:</strong> Platforms hosting multiple AI agents can use this skill to verify and display security credentials for each agent.</p>
<p><strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Industries with strict security requirements (healthcare, finance, government) can use AgentShield Audit to demonstrate compliance.</p>
<p><strong>Open Source AI Projects:</strong> Developers can include security assessments as part of their release process, building trust in their AI solutions.</p>
<h2>Installation and Usage</h2>
<h3>Quick Installation</h3>
<p>Installing AgentShield Audit is straightforward using the OpenClaw package manager:</p>
<pre><code>clawhub install agentshield-audit
</code></pre>
<h3>Usage Options</h3>
<p>There are two primary ways to use the skill:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Conversational:</strong> Simply tell your agent &#8220;Run a security assessment with AgentShield&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Manual:</strong> Execute the assessment script directly:
<pre><code>cd ~/.openclaw/skills/agentshield-audit
python scripts/initiate_audit.py --auto --yes
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The assessment typically takes 2-5 minutes to complete, depending on the complexity of your agent&#8217;s environment.</p>
<h2>Technical Architecture</h2>
<h3>Privacy-First Design</h3>
