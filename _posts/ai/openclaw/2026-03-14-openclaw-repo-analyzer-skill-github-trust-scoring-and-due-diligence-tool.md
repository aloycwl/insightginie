<h2>Introduction to OpenClaw Repo Analyzer</h2>
<p>OpenClaw Repo Analyzer is a sophisticated GitHub repository trust scoring and due diligence tool designed to help developers and investors evaluate the credibility and security of GitHub repositories. This zero-dependency tool performs comprehensive analysis across 29 different modules spanning 12 scoring categories to provide users with actionable insights about repository trustworthiness.</p>
<h2>Core Functionality and Purpose</h2>
<p>The primary purpose of the Repo Analyzer skill is to provide automated trust scoring and security assessment for GitHub repositories. It&rsquo;s particularly valuable for crypto and DeFi project due diligence, code quality evaluation, team credibility verification, and comparing multiple repositories. The tool automatically triggers when users ask to analyze, audit, score, or evaluate any GitHub repo, making it an essential component of the OpenClaw skill ecosystem.</p>
<h2>Key Features and Capabilities</h2>
<h3>Comprehensive Scoring System</h3>
<p>The tool evaluates repositories across 14 distinct categories with a maximum score of 168 points, normalized to a 100-point scale. These categories include Commit Health, Contributors, Code Quality, AI Authenticity, Social metrics, Activity levels, Crypto Safety, Dependency Audit, Fork Quality, README Quality, Maintainability, Project Health, Originality, and Agent Safety.</p>
<h3>Multi-Trigger Functionality</h3>
<p>The skill activates on various user prompts including &ldquo;analyze this repo&rdquo;, &ldquo;is this legit&rdquo;, &ldquo;check this GitHub&rdquo;, &ldquo;trust score&rdquo;, &ldquo;audit this project&rdquo;, &ldquo;repo quality&rdquo;, &ldquo;batch scan repos&rdquo;, and &ldquo;analyze this tweet&rdquo;. Additionally, it automatically triggers when users paste X/Twitter URLs containing GitHub links, extracting and analyzing repositories without explicit commands.</p>
<h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
<h3>Requirements and Dependencies</h3>
<p>The tool requires Node.js 18+ and uses GitHub API through either gh CLI or unauthenticated access. It&rsquo;s designed as a zero-external-dependency tool, making it lightweight and reliable. The tool works on both Linux and macOS platforms and handles rate limits with automatic retry and backoff mechanisms.</p>
<h3>Usage Methods</h3>
<p>Users can interact with the tool through three primary methods: analyzing single repositories by providing owner/repo names or GitHub URLs, processing tweets that contain GitHub links (with automatic extraction), and batch mode processing using a text file with one repository per line.</p>
<h2>Scoring Categories and Analysis Depth</h2>
<h3>Commit Health Analysis</h3>
<p>This category evaluates commit patterns, distinguishing between human and bot activity, checking for GPG signatures, identifying code dumps, and detecting fake timestamps. It&rsquo;s crucial for understanding repository activity authenticity.</p>
<h3>Code Quality Assessment</h3>
<p>The tool examines test coverage, continuous integration setup, licensing, documentation quality, and lock file presence to determine code reliability and maintainability standards.</p>
<h3>Security-Focused Analysis</h3>
<p>Security categories include Crypto Safety (detecting token mints and rug patterns), Dependency Audit (identifying malicious packages and typosquatting), Agent Safety (finding prompt injection and credential harvesting), and Secrets Detection (uncovering hardcoded API keys and tokens).</p>
<h2>Advanced Security Features</h2>
<h3>Dependency Audit Enhancement</h3>
<p>The tool performs enhanced dependency analysis by detecting known malicious packages like event-stream and ua-parser-js, identifying typosquatting attacks, examining install hooks, and estimating transitive dependency bloat to assess potential security risks.</p>
<h3>Fork Comparison Analysis</h3>
<p>When analyzing forks, the tool compares divergence from upstream repositories, detects cosmetic versus meaningful changes, flags suspicious modifications like removed CI or added wallets, and identifies gutted forks that may indicate malicious intent.</p>
<h3>Agent Safety Mechanisms</h3>
<p>The Agent Safety category specifically targets prompt injection vulnerabilities, credential harvesting attempts, install script hooks, and obfuscated code that could compromise user systems or data.</p>
<h2>Output and Reporting</h2>
<h3>Report Formats</h3>
<p>The tool provides multiple output formats including rich terminal reports with bar charts and detailed sections, JSON output for programmatic use, compact one-line scores, and shields.io markdown badges for easy integration into README files.</p>
<h3>Batch Processing</h3>
<p>Batch mode allows processing multiple repositories simultaneously through a simple text file format, with support for comments and various input formats including direct repository names and GitHub URLs.</p>
<h2>Grading System</h2>
<p>Repositories receive letter grades based on their scores: A (85+ points) indicates LEGIT status, B (70-84) is SOLID, C (55-69) is MIXED, D (40-54) is SKETCHY, and F (below 40) means AVOID. This grading system provides quick, actionable insights for users.</p>
<h2>Practical Applications</h2>
<h3>Crypto and DeFi Due Diligence</h3>
<p>The tool is particularly valuable for evaluating crypto and DeFi projects, helping investors and developers identify potential scams, rug pulls, and security vulnerabilities before committing resources.</p>
<h3>Open Source Contribution Assessment</h3>
<p>Developers can use the tool to evaluate the health and trustworthiness of open source repositories before contributing code, reporting issues, or using dependencies in their projects.</p>
<h3>Enterprise Security</h3>
<p>Organizations can implement the tool as part of their security protocols to automatically assess third-party code and dependencies before integration into production systems.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>OpenClaw Repo Analyzer represents a comprehensive approach to GitHub repository trust scoring and security analysis. By combining multiple analysis dimensions into a single, easy-to-use tool, it provides developers, investors, and organizations with the insights needed to make informed decisions about code trustworthiness and security. The tool&rsquo;s zero-dependency design, comprehensive feature set, and practical output formats make it an invaluable asset in today&rsquo;s security-conscious development environment.</p>
