<h1>Introduction to the OpenClaw Port Check Skill</h1>
<p>In the fast-paced world of DevOps and system administration, maintaining service availability is paramount. Whether you are managing a complex microservices architecture, a home lab, or a simple web server, knowing whether your services are up and running is the first line of defense against downtime. Enter the <strong>OpenClaw Port Check skill</strong>—a lightweight, versatile tool designed to streamline the process of monitoring network ports and verifying service health.</p>
<h2>What is the Port Check Skill?</h2>
<p>The Port Check skill (part of the <code>rogue-agent1</code> suite within the OpenClaw ecosystem) is a utility script that allows users to quickly verify if services are actively listening and responding on specific host:port pairs. By leveraging industry-standard tools like <code>nc</code> (netcat) and <code>curl</code>, it provides a unified interface for both basic TCP connectivity tests and advanced HTTP response validation.</p>
<h2>Why You Need It in Your Toolbox</h2>
<p>Modern infrastructure is prone to silent failures. A server might appear to be running, but the application service might be hung, or a firewall rule might be blocking traffic. The Port Check skill helps you diagnose these issues instantly. Here is why it stands out:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Instead of manually typing complex <code>curl</code> commands or piping outputs from netcat, this skill encapsulates the logic into a clean, repeatable command-line interface.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> It supports both raw TCP checks and sophisticated HTTP checks, making it ideal for checking everything from database ports (like 5432 or 6379) to web application endpoints.</li>
<li><strong>Automation-Ready:</strong> With its clear exit code system (0 for success, 1 for failure), it is perfectly suited for integration into CI/CD pipelines, cron jobs, or monitoring dashboards.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Getting Started: Usage Scenarios</h2>
<p>The beauty of this tool lies in its simplicity. After installing the necessary dependencies (<code>nc</code> and <code>curl</code>), you can start monitoring your services immediately.</p>
<h3>1. Basic TCP Connectivity</h3>
<p>If you just need to know if a port is open and accepting connections, the basic syntax is all you need:</p>
<p><code>bash scripts/port-check.sh localhost:8080 localhost:5432</code></p>
<p>This will check both ports and inform you if they are reachable.</p>
<h3>2. Validating HTTP Services</h3>
<p>Sometimes a port might be open, but the application behind it is returning errors. By using the <code>--http</code> flag, the Port Check skill validates that the server returns a successful HTTP status code:</p>
<p><code>bash scripts/port-check.sh api.example.com:443 --http</code></p>
<p>This is crucial for identifying &#8216;zombie&#8217; services—processes that are running but failing to serve requests.</p>
<h3>3. Tuning Timeouts</h3>
<p>Network latency varies significantly between local development and cloud production environments. The <code>--timeout</code> parameter allows you to adjust how long the script waits for a response, preventing your scripts from hanging on slow connections or unresponsive firewalls.</p>
<h2>Understanding the Output</h2>
<p>The OpenClaw Port Check skill provides clear, color-coded, and intuitive feedback, making it easy for human operators to understand the network state at a glance:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>✅ host:port — open:</strong> The connection was successful, and the service is behaving as expected.</li>
<li><strong>✅ host:port — open (HTTP 200):</strong> The HTTP handshake was completed successfully.</li>
<li><strong>⚠️ host:port — open but HTTP 500:</strong> The port is open, but the application is throwing a server error.</li>
<li><strong>❌ host:port — closed/timeout:</strong> The service is either down, or the connection is being dropped.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Integrating into Your Workflow</h2>
<p>The true power of this skill is realized when you integrate it into your existing workflows. Here are three professional use cases:</p>
<h3>Monitoring the OpenClaw Gateway</h3>
<p>If you are running the OpenClaw infrastructure, you can use a simple cron job running the port check script to ensure your gateway is always alive. If the exit code is 1, trigger a notification alert or a self-healing restart sequence.</p>
<h3>Database and Web Stack Verification</h3>
<p>Before running your automated integration tests, use the port check script as a pre-flight checklist. Ensure that PostgreSQL, Redis, and your application container are all online before initiating the test suite, preventing flaky build failures.</p>
<h3>Home Lab Diagnostics</h3>
<p>If you manage local devices like Raspberry Pis or NAS units, you can create a simple dashboard that queries these devices at regular intervals, keeping tabs on your home network health without needing expensive enterprise software.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The OpenClaw Port Check skill is a testament to the idea that tools do not need to be bloated to be powerful. By focusing on a single, well-defined problem—port reachability and service health—it provides developers and system administrators with a reliable way to ensure that the backbone of their digital environment remains solid. Whether you are debugging a production outage or setting up a new server cluster, this utility is an essential addition to your command-line toolkit. Download it from the OpenClaw repository today and take control of your network connectivity.</p>
