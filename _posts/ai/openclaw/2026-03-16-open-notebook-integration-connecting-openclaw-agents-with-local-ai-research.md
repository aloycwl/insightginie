<h2>What This Integration Does</h2>
<p>This skill connects your OpenClaw agents to open-notebook, a powerful local AI research assistant that serves as a free alternative to cloud-based notebook solutions. The integration enables your agents to create thematic notebooks for different purposes, save insights across sessions, and query accumulated knowledge using local Ollama models.</p>
<p>Think of it as giving your agents a &#8220;second brain&#8221; that persists beyond individual conversations. Whether you&#8217;re conducting research, exploring agent behaviors, or building personal knowledge systems, this integration provides the infrastructure for long-term learning and discovery.</p>
<h2>Core Benefits</h2>
<p>The integration offers several compelling advantages. First, it eliminates API costs by using local Ollama models, making it completely free to operate. Second, it provides persistent knowledge storage, allowing agents to build upon previous insights rather than starting fresh each time. Third, it enables sophisticated querying capabilities, letting you ask complex questions about your accumulated knowledge. Finally, it keeps everything local, ensuring privacy and data sovereignty.</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Before you can use this skill, you&#8217;ll need to set up the local infrastructure. The system requires Docker Desktop for running open-notebook containers, Ollama for local model serving, and at least one language model installed. The setup process is straightforward but essential for the integration to function.</p>
<p>Start by installing Docker Desktop from the official website. This provides the container runtime that open-notebook needs. Next, install Ollama and download a model &#8211; the qwen3-4b-thinking-32k model works well for most use cases. Finally, run open-notebook using the provided Docker Compose configuration.</p>
<h2>Running open-notebook</h2>
<p>You have two options for starting open-notebook. The simplest approach uses the default configuration:</p>
<pre><code>docker compose up -d
</code></pre>
<p>This launches both the SurrealDB database and the open-notebook application with default settings.</p>
<p>If you want to use Ollama for model serving, use the host-specific configuration:</p>
<pre><code>docker compose -f docker-compose-host-ollama.yml up -d
</code></pre>
<p>This connects open-notebook directly to your local Ollama instance, ensuring all processing happens on your machine.</p>
<h2>Understanding the API Endpoints</h2>
<p>Once running, open-notebook provides two main endpoints. The web interface is available at <a href="http://localhost:8502">http://localhost:8502</a>, where you can create notebooks through a graphical interface. The API server runs at <a href="http://localhost:5055">http://localhost:5055</a>, which is what the PowerShell functions use to interact programmatically.</p>
<p>The API provides three main operations: creating new notebooks, adding content to existing notebooks, and searching through notebook contents. These operations are exposed through PowerShell functions that handle the HTTP communication and JSON formatting automatically.</p>
<h2>Available PowerShell Functions</h2>
<p>The skill includes three PowerShell functions that you can use directly in your scripts. The <code>Add-ToNotebook</code> function takes content and a notebook ID, then sends the content to open-notebook for storage. The <code>Search-Notebook</code> function allows you to query the contents of a specific notebook using natural language questions. The <code>New-Notebook</code> function creates new thematic notebooks with custom names and descriptions.</p>
<p>Each function is designed to be simple and intuitive. They handle the JSON serialization, HTTP requests, and error handling internally, so you can focus on the content rather than the mechanics of API communication.</p>
<h2>Setting Up Notebook Identifiers</h2>
<p>After creating notebooks through the API or web interface, you&#8217;ll need to capture their unique identifiers. These IDs are essential for the functions to know which notebook to interact with. The skill provides several predefined variables for common use cases: SIMULATION, CONSCIOUSNESS, ENJAMBRE, OSIRIS, and RESEARCH.</p>
<p>You should update these variables with your actual notebook IDs after creating them. For example, if you create a research notebook, you&#8217;d set $RESEARCH to &#8220;notebook:your-research-id&#8221; and use that variable in your Add-ToNotebook and Search-Notebook calls.</p>
<h2>Practical Usage Examples</h2>
<p>Using the integration is straightforward once your environment is set up. To create a new notebook for research, you&#8217;d call:</p>
<pre><code>New-Notebook -Name "My Research" -Description "Research notes"
</code></pre>
<p>Then, to save insights to that notebook:</p>
<pre><code>Add-ToNotebook -Content "This is my insight" -NotebookId "notebook:xxx"
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, to query what you&#8217;ve learned:</p>
<pre><code>$result = Search-Notebook -Query "What did I learn about X?" -NotebookId "notebook:xxx"
</code></pre>
<p>These simple commands provide powerful knowledge management capabilities for your agents.</p>
<h2>Configuration and Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>Before using the functions, you must complete several configuration steps. First, ensure open-notebook is running with Docker. Second, create at least one notebook through the API or web interface. Third, capture the notebook ID from the API response. Fourth, update the notebook ID parameters in your scripts.</p>
<p>If you encounter issues, several troubleshooting steps can help. Check that all containers are running with <code>docker ps</code>. Examine open-notebook logs with <code>docker compose logs</code>. Verify Ollama is accessible with <code>curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags</code>. These commands help isolate whether the problem is with Docker, open-notebook, or Ollama.</p>
<h2>System Requirements</h2>
<p>The integration has specific system requirements to function properly. You need Docker Desktop running to manage the containers. Ollama must be installed with at least one language model available. The open-notebook containers must be running, including both the SurrealDB database and the application itself.</p>
<p>Storage requirements depend on your usage patterns. Each notebook stores text content, so the primary space consideration is the language models you choose to install with Ollama. The system is designed to be lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for personal computers and development environments.</p>
<h2>Version History and Updates</h2>
<p>The current version is 1.0.1, which includes improved documentation and comprehensive function examples. The development team continues to refine the integration based on user feedback, with future versions likely to include enhanced error handling, additional configuration options, and expanded functionality.</p>
<p>The skill represents a mature integration that balances simplicity with powerful capabilities. Whether you&#8217;re a researcher, developer, or AI enthusiast, this tool provides a solid foundation for building intelligent agents with persistent knowledge capabilities.</p>
