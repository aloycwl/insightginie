The builder-data skill is a powerful tool within the OpenClaw ecosystem that enables developers to query comprehensive reputation data from Talent Protocol, a platform dedicated to tracking and showcasing builders. This skill serves as a bridge between various developer identities and their professional achievements, making it invaluable for teams looking to verify credentials, assess talent, or simply understand the broader developer landscape.

How the Skill Works
-------------------

At its core, the builder-data skill leverages the Talent Protocol API to fetch detailed information about developers and builders. The skill requires an API key from Talent Protocol to access profile and identity data, with optional GitHub token support for enhanced rate limits when enriching data from GitHub repositories.

The skill operates through several key endpoints, each serving a specific purpose. The search functionality allows users to find verified developers by location, skills, or identity across multiple platforms including Twitter, GitHub, Farcaster, and cryptocurrency wallets. This multi-platform approach ensures comprehensive coverage of a developer's online presence.

Key Features and Capabilities
-----------------------------

One of the most powerful aspects of the builder-data skill is its ability to verify human identity through wallet addresses and check builder reputation through ranking systems. By default, the skill returns rank positions, which provide a standardized measure of a developer's standing within the Talent Protocol ecosystem. Users can also request scores when they need more granular performance metrics.

The skill excels at identity resolution, allowing users to map Twitter accounts to wallet addresses, verify human identities from wallet addresses, and search for builders' credentials including earnings, contributions, hackathons, and contracts. This comprehensive approach to identity verification helps organizations ensure they're working with legitimate professionals.

Location-Based Searches
-----------------------

Finding developers by location is a common use case, and the builder-data skill handles this through a custom query system using regular expressions. Since the standard location parameter doesn't work reliably, the skill employs a more sophisticated approach using the customQuery endpoint with regexp matching on standardized locations. This allows for flexible searches like finding all developers in Argentina or other specific regions.

The skill also provides information about the projects each builder is shipping, giving users insight into current work and active contributions to the developer community. This project information can be crucial for understanding a developer's current focus and expertise areas.

GitHub Integration and Enrichment
---------------------------------

For developers who want deeper insights, the builder-data skill integrates with GitHub to enrich the data obtained from Talent Protocol. After resolving a GitHub username from the accounts endpoint, the skill can query GitHub's API to fetch repositories, commits, and open pull requests. This integration provides a more complete picture of a developer's technical contributions and activity levels.

The GitHub enrichment process includes fetching top repositories by stars, recent activity by push date, public events, and open pull requests. These additional data points help create a comprehensive profile of a developer's technical capabilities and community involvement.

Authentication and Rate Limits
------------------------------

The skill requires proper authentication through the TALENT\_API\_KEY variable, which must have read access to profile and identity data. For GitHub operations, a personal access token is recommended to increase the rate limit from 60 requests per hour to 5,000 requests per hour. This higher rate limit is particularly important when processing multiple developer profiles or conducting extensive searches.

Users can obtain their Talent Protocol API key through the platform's settings page, while GitHub tokens can be generated through GitHub's developer settings. The skill handles authentication headers automatically when these credentials are provided.

Practical Use Cases
-------------------

The builder-data skill has numerous practical applications. Teams can use it to verify developer credentials before hiring, find verified developers in specific locations for local projects, map social media presence to professional identities, or assess the reputation of potential collaborators. The skill is particularly valuable for organizations operating in the decentralized space, where verifying identity and reputation can be challenging.

Investors and project managers can use the skill to identify top talent in specific domains, while community managers can leverage it to find and engage with verified contributors. The ability to search by tags like “developer” or “designer” makes it easy to find professionals with specific skill sets.

Technical Implementation Details
--------------------------------

The skill follows RESTful API principles and uses standard HTTP methods. Most endpoints use GET requests, with POST being used specifically for custom queries that require more complex filtering. The skill handles pagination automatically, supporting up to 250 results per page to manage large result sets effectively.

URL encoding is handled automatically for special characters, with specific encoding for brackets and spaces to ensure proper API communication. The skill also includes comprehensive error handling and provides clear feedback when operations cannot be completed.

Limitations and Considerations
------------------------------

While powerful, the builder-data skill has some limitations. The maximum of 250 results per page means that very large searches may require multiple requests. The custom query system, while flexible, requires familiarity with regular expressions for complex searches. Additionally, the skill's effectiveness depends on the quality and completeness of data available in Talent Protocol.

Users should also be aware that some searches, particularly those using the human\_checkmark filter, can significantly reduce the number of results returned. This is by design, as the filter ensures only verified humans are included in the results.

Getting Started
---------------

To begin using the builder-data skill, users need to obtain their Talent Protocol API key and optionally set up a GitHub token for enhanced functionality. The skill's documentation provides detailed examples of common use cases and API endpoints, making it accessible even for developers new to the Talent Protocol ecosystem.

The skill represents a significant advancement in how developer reputation and identity can be verified and utilized across the web3 and traditional development communities. By providing a standardized way to access and verify builder data, it helps create a more transparent and trustworthy professional environment for developers worldwide.
