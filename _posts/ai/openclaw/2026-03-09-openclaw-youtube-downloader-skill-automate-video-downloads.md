<h2>What is the OpenClaw YouTube Downloader Skill?</h2>
<p>The OpenClaw YouTube Downloader skill is a specialized automation tool designed to download YouTube videos as high-quality MP4 files and organize them systematically. This skill triggers when users share YouTube URLs with download intent, making it an essential component for content creators, researchers, or anyone who needs to archive YouTube content.</p>
<h2>How the YouTube Downloader Skill Works</h2>
<p>The skill operates through a simple yet effective process. When a user sends a YouTube URL along with a request to download, the skill activates and executes a download script. The process requires two key parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>YouTube URL</strong>: The full URL of the YouTube video (formats include youtube.com/watch, youtu.be, and youtube.com/shorts)</li>
<li><strong>Label</strong>: A short descriptive label for organizing the downloaded video (e.g., &#8220;honey-b-interview&#8221;, &#8220;og-event-recap&#8221;)</li>
</ul>
<p>Once activated, the skill runs a shell script located at <code>~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/youtube-downloader/scripts/download.sh</code>, passing both the URL and label as arguments.</p>
<h2>Output and Storage Structure</h2>
<p>The downloaded videos are stored in a specific location with a structured naming convention:</p>
<pre><code>~/.openclaw/workspace/assets/videos/{label}_{videoId}_{timestamp}.mp4
</code></pre>
<p>For example, a video labeled &#8220;event-recap&#8221; with video ID &#8220;abc123&#8221; downloaded on February 1, 2026, at 23:45:00 would be named:</p>
<pre><code>event-recap_abc123_20260201_234500.mp4
</code></pre>
<p>Additionally, the skill maintains a registry of all downloaded assets in JSON format at:</p>
<pre><code>~/.openclaw/workspace/assets/registry.json
</code></pre>
<h2>Registry Format and Metadata</h2>
<p>Each download creates a detailed entry in the registry JSON file, capturing comprehensive metadata about the downloaded video:</p>
<pre><code>{
  "type": "video",
  "source": "youtube",
  "videoId": "abc123",
  "label": "event-recap",
  "filename": "event-recap_abc123_20260201_234500.mp4",
  "path": "/full/path/to/file.mp4",
  "url": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=abc123",
  "downloadedAt": "2026-02-01T23:45:00Z",
  "filesize": "150M"
}
</code></pre>
<p>This structured metadata enables easy searching, filtering, and management of downloaded content.</p>
<h2>Download Quality and Format</h2>
<p>The YouTube Downloader skill prioritizes quality by downloading the best available options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Video Quality</strong>: Highest resolution available, up to 4K</li>
<li><strong>Audio Quality</strong>: Best available audio track</li>
<li><strong>Format</strong>: MP4 with H.264 video codec and AAC audio codec</li>
</ul>
<p>This ensures that users receive the optimal viewing experience without compromising on quality.</p>
<h2>Practical Usage Example</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s a typical interaction with the YouTube Downloader skill:</p>
<p><strong>User</strong>: &#8220;Download this <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=abc123">https://youtube.com/watch?v=abc123</a> and label it event-recap&#8221;</p>
<p>The skill would execute:</p>
<pre><code>~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/youtube-downloader/scripts/download.sh "https://youtube.com/watch?v=abc123" "event-recap"
</code></pre>
<p>The result would be a high-quality MP4 file stored with the appropriate label and timestamp, along with a registry entry for future reference.</p>
<h2>Limitations and Considerations</h2>
<p>While the YouTube Downloader skill is powerful, it does have some limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No Live Streams</strong>: The skill cannot download live YouTube streams</li>
<li><strong>Private/Deleted Videos</strong>: Videos that are private or have been deleted will fail to download</li>
<li><strong>Age-Restricted Content</strong>: Some age-restricted videos may require cookies or authentication</li>
</ul>
<p>Users should be aware of these constraints when using the skill and ensure they have the right to download and store the content they&#8217;re accessing.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Using the YouTube Downloader Skill</h2>
<p>The OpenClaw YouTube Downloader skill offers several advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Automation</strong>: Eliminates manual download processes</li>
<li><strong>Organization</strong>: Systematic labeling and storage structure</li>
<li><strong>Metadata Tracking</strong>: Comprehensive registry for asset management</li>
<li><strong>Quality Assurance</strong>: Always downloads the best available quality</li>
