<h2>Smart Actions: The Intelligent Core of the Connector</h2>
<p>The Odoo Connector&#8217;s most innovative feature is its Smart Actions system, which handles fuzzy matching and auto-creation workflows to process incomplete requests. Let&#8217;s explore how this works in practice:</p>
<div class="example">
<h3>Example: Creating a Quotation</h3>
<pre>User command: "Create quotation for Rocky with product Rock"</pre>
<p>The system:</p>
<ol>
<li>Searches for a customer named &#8220;Rocky&#8221; (case-insensitive, flexible matching)</li>
<li>If not found: Creates a new customer &#8220;Rocky&#8221; with auto-company flag</li>
<li>Searches for product &#8220;Rock&#8221;</li>
<li>If not found: Creates a basic product &#8220;Rock&#8221; (consumable type, default price $0)</li>
<li>Links both the customer and product to create the quotation</li>
<li>Reports: &#8220;Created quotation QT-001 for new customer Rocky with 1 × Rock at $0.00&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<p>This pattern applies to all smart actions (smart_create_quotation(), smart_create_purchase(), etc.), providing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fuzzy matching of business entities</li>
<li>Automatic creation of missing dependencies</li>
<li>Transparent reporting of actions taken</li>
<li>No need for memorizing IDs &#8211; use natural names instead</li>
<li>Batch creation of multiple related records</li>
</ul></div>
</section>

<h2>Technical Architecture of the Connector</h2>

<li>Provides comprehensive CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)</li>
<li>Includes built-in retry logic and error handling</li>
<li>Exposes search, read, create, write, and unlink methods</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="tech-component">
<h3>Model Ops Classes</h3>
<p>Business logic containers for each module, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>PartnerOps: Manages customers and suppliers</li>
<li>SaleOrderOps: Handles quotations and sales orders</li>
<li>InvoiceOps: Processes customer invoices</li>
