<p>The XMTP CLI is a comprehensive command-line tool designed for testing, debugging, and interacting with XMTP conversations, groups, and messages. This versatile tool provides developers with a powerful interface to manage various aspects of the XMTP ecosystem directly from the terminal.</p>
<p>## Overview<br />
The XMTP CLI serves as the primary entry point for developers who need to work with XMTP networks programmatically. Whether you&#8217;re testing functionality, debugging issues, or managing conversations and groups, this tool provides a streamlined approach to handling all your XMTP needs through simple command-line operations.</p>
<p>## Installation and Setup<br />
To get started with the XMTP CLI, you have several installation options:</p>
<p>&#8220;`bash<br />
# Global installation using npm<br />
npm install -g @xmtp/cli</p>
<p># Global installation using pnpm<br />
pnpm add -g @xmtp/cli</p>
<p># Global installation using yarn<br />
yarn global add @xmtp/cli<br />
&#8220;`</p>
<p>If you prefer not to install it globally, you can run the CLI directly using:</p>
<p>&#8220;`bash<br />
npx @xmtp/cli <command> <arguments><br />
# or using pnpx<br />
pnpx @xmtp/cli <command> <arguments><br />
# or using yarn dlx<br />
yarn dlx @xmtp/cli <command> <arguments><br />
&#8220;`</p>
<p>## Core Functionality<br />
The XMTP CLI offers a wide range of commands organized into sub-skills, each designed for specific tasks:</p>
<p>### Setup and Configuration<br />
Before using the CLI for any operations, you&#8217;ll need to initialize it and configure your environment. This includes setting up necessary environment variables and authentication credentials.</p>
<p>### Group Management<br />
Create and manage direct messages or group conversations with ease. You can also update group metadata to customize how groups appear and function within the XMTP ecosystem.</p>
<p>### Message Sending<br />
Send messages to individual addresses or entire groups. The CLI supports various message types including text, markdown, attachments, transactions, deeplinks, and miniapps.</p>
<p>### Listing and Discovery<br />
List conversations, members, and messages. You can also find specific items by address or inbox, making it easy to navigate through your XMTP data.</p>
<p>### Debugging Tools<br />
Get detailed information about your XMTP setup, resolve addresses, and inspect inboxes. These tools are invaluable for troubleshooting and understanding how your XMTP implementation is functioning.</p>
<p>### Synchronization<br />
Sync conversations or perform a complete sync of all your XMTP data. This ensures you have the latest information across all your devices and sessions.</p>
<p>### Permission Management<br />
List and update group permissions, allowing you to control who can access and interact with different groups within your XMTP network.</p>
<p>### Content Demonstration<br />
The CLI includes tools for demonstrating various content types, helping you understand how different message formats appear and function within the XMTP ecosystem.</p>
<p>## Use Cases<br />
The XMTP CLI is particularly useful in several scenarios:</p>
<p>### Testing and Development<br />
When building applications that integrate with XMTP, developers can use the CLI to test various functionalities without having to implement them in code first. This accelerates the development process and helps identify issues early.</p>
<p>### Debugging Issues<br />
When problems arise with XMTP implementations, the CLI provides powerful debugging tools to inspect conversations, messages, and group configurations. This makes it easier to identify and resolve issues quickly.</p>
<p>### Automation<br />
Many XMTP operations can be automated using the CLI, such as sending scheduled messages, managing group memberships, or performing regular data syncs. This is particularly useful for system administrators and developers building automated workflows.</p>
<p>### Demonstration and Training<br />
The content demonstration features make the CLI an excellent tool for showing others how XMTP works, whether for training purposes or when presenting to stakeholders.</p>
<p>## Command Structure<br />
All XMTP CLI commands follow a consistent structure:</p>
<p>&#8220;`bash<br />
xmtp <command> <arguments> [&#8211;options]<br />
&#8220;`</p>
<p>You can access help information for any command using:</p>
<p>&#8220;`bash<br />
xmtp &#8211;help<br />
xmtp <command> &#8211;help<br />
&#8220;`</p>
<p>## Advanced Features<br />
The CLI includes several advanced features to enhance your XMTP experience:</p>
<p>### Debug Logging<br />
Enable detailed debug logging by setting the `XMTP_FORCE_DEBUG` environment variable. This provides comprehensive information about what the CLI is doing behind the scenes, which is invaluable for troubleshooting complex issues.</p>
<p>### Environment Variables<br />
Configure various aspects of the CLI&#8217;s behavior through environment variables. This allows you to customize the tool to fit your specific needs and workflows.</p>
<p>### Scriptable Interface<br />
The command-line nature of the tool makes it scriptable, allowing you to incorporate XMTP operations into larger scripts and automation workflows.</p>
<p>## Best Practices<br />
To get the most out of the XMTP CLI:</p>
<p>1. **Start with setup**: Always ensure your environment is properly configured before attempting other operations.<br />
2. **Use help commands**: When unsure about a command&#8217;s syntax or options, use the help feature.<br />
3. **Test in staging**: Before using the CLI in production environments, test your commands in staging or development environments.<br />
4. **Document your workflows**: If you&#8217;re using the CLI for automation, document your scripts and workflows for future reference.</p>
