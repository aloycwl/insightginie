<h1>Understanding TrustLog Guard: Financial Governance for OpenClaw Agents</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/openclaw/skills/blob/main/skills/anouartrust/trustlog-guard/SKILL.md">TrustLog Guard skill</a> for OpenClaw is a powerful tool designed to provide financial governance for AI agents. This skill plays a crucial role in tracking API spending, enforcing budget limits, detecting anomalies, and delivering comprehensive cost briefings to users.</p>
<h2>Core Principle and Purpose</h2>
<p>TrustLog Guard operates on the principle that &#8220;Every token has a price. Every session has a cost. The user deserves to know both.&#8221; The skill is not meant to slow down AI usage but to enhance it by providing clear insights into cost data, making AI usage smarter, faster, and more efficient.</p>
<h2>Data Source and Structure</h2>
<p>The TrustLog Guard skill reads session logs from <code>~/.openclaw/agents/{agent}/sessions/*.jsonl</code>. Each log file contains JSON lines, and the skill focuses on records where the type is either &#8220;assistant&#8221; or &#8220;message&#8221; and a cost object exists. The cost object typically includes details such as input costs, output costs, cache read and write costs, and a total cost.</p>
<h3>Key Fields in the Cost Object</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>input</strong>: The cost associated with the input tokens.</li>
<li><strong>output</strong>: The cost associated with the output tokens.</li>
<li><strong>cacheRead</strong>: The cost associated with reading from the cache.</li>
<li><strong>cacheWrite</strong>: The cost associated with writing to the cache.</li>
<li><strong>total</strong>: The total cost per message in USD, which is the authoritative cost per message.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Commands and Functionality</h2>
<p>TrustLog Guard offers several commands to help users manage and understand their AI spending:</p>
<h3>/spend — Spend Summary</h3>
<p>This command provides a summary of spending across different time periods, including today, this week, this month, and all time. It also breaks down costs by model and identifies top sessions by cost. Additionally, it offers optimization tips based on spending patterns.</p>
<h3>/budget — Budget Management</h3>
<p>The /budget command allows users to set daily or monthly budget limits for their AI usage. The skill saves these budgets to a specific file and provides status updates, including progress bars and projected budget exhaustion times. It also issues warnings as users approach or exceed their budget limits.</p>
<h3>/trustlog — Full Financial Report with Anomaly Detection</h3>
<p>This command generates a comprehensive financial report that includes spending overviews, cost breakdowns by model, top sessions, anomaly scans, and optimization tips. The anomaly detection component identifies potential issues such as burn rate spikes, expensive sessions, rapid-fire loops, model escalations, and cache inefficiencies.</p>
<h2>Anomaly Detection Rules</h2>
<p>The TrustLog Guard skill employs several rules to detect anomalies in AI spending:</p>
<h3>Burn Rate Spike</h3>
<p>Compares the cost of the last 5 messages to the average cost of the previous 20 messages. If the last 5 messages&#8217; average is more than 5 times the previous 20 messages&#8217; average, it triggers a burn rate spike anomaly.</p>
<h3>Session Explosion</h3>
<p>Triggers when a single session&#8217;s total cost exceeds $5.00, indicating an expensive session that warrants further investigation.</p>
<h3>Rapid-Fire Loop</h3>
<p>Triggers when more than 20 messages are sentin a <code>10-minute window within a single session, suggesting a potential runaway loop that could lead to excessive spending.</code>.</p>
<h3>Model Escalation</h3>
<p>Triggers when a session starts with a cheaper model but switches to a more expensive model mid-session, indicating potential inefficiencies in model usage.</p>
<h3>Cache Inefficiency</h3>
<p>Triggers when cache write values are consistently above 0 but cache read values are 0 or near 0 in subsequent sessions, indicating potential inefficiencies in cache utilization.</p>
<h2>Optimization Suggestions</h2>
<p>TrustLog Guard also provides optimization suggestions based on spending patterns and anomalies detected. These suggestions include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Model Downgrade Opportunity</strong>: Suggests using a cheaper model for messages with output under 200 tokens, along with calculated savings.</li>
<li><strong>Cache Optimization</strong>: Suggests consolidating sessions to improve cache read efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Session Consolidation</strong>: Suggests combining related tasks into fewer, longer sessions to reduce context-building costs.</li>
<li><strong>Peak Spend Times</strong>: Identifies concentrated spending patterns, such as high usage during specific times.</li>
<li><strong>Cost per Task Type</strong>: Breaks down costs by task type, highlighting which types of tasks are most expensive.</li>
</ul>
<h2></h2>
<p>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The TrustLog Guard skill is an essential tool for financial governance in OpenClaw environments. By providing detailed spending reports, enforcing budget limits, detecting anomalies, and offering optimization suggestions, it empowers users to manage their AI costs effectively and efficiently.</p>
