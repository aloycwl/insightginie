<li><strong>Affordable Pricing</strong>: The service is priced competitively at ¥2 per video, making high-quality video generation accessible to a wide range of users.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>Before using the SiliconFlow Video Generation skill, you&#8217;ll need to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Obtain a SiliconFlow API key</strong>: You&#8217;ll need a valid API key to access SiliconFlow&#8217;s services. Once you have your key, you can either:</li>
<ul>
<li>Set it as an environment variable: <code>SILICONFLOW_API_KEY="your-api-key"</code></li>
<li>Add it to your OpenClaw configuration file (~/.openclaw/openclaw.json)</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed</strong>: These are required to install and run OpenClaw skills.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Installing the SiliconFlow Video Generation skill is a straightforward process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open your terminal or command prompt</li>
<li>Run the following command: <code>npx clawhub install siliconflow-video-gen</code></li>
<li>Wait for the installation to complete. Once done, you&#8217;re ready to generate videos!</li>
</ol>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>To configure the SiliconFlow Video Generation skill, you have two options for setting your API key:</p>
<h3>Option 1: Environment Variable</h3>
<p>Set the API key as an environment variable using the following command (replace <code>your-api-key</code> with your actual SiliconFlow API key):</p>
<pre>export SILICONFLOW_API_KEY="your-api-key"</pre>
<h3>Option 2: OpenClaw Configuration File</h3>
<p>Add your API key to the OpenClaw configuration file (~/.openclaw/openclaw.json). Create the file if it doesn&#8217;t exist, and add the following content (again, replace <code>your-api-key</code> with your actual SiliconFlow API key):</p>
<pre>{
  "models": {
    "providers": {
      "siliconflow": {
        "apiKey": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}</pre>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The SiliconFlow Video Generation skill supports two main use cases: text-to-video and image-to-video generation.</p>
<h3>Text-to-Video Generation</h3>
<p>To generate a video from a text description, use the following command:</p>
<pre>python3 scripts/generate.py "A woman walking in a blooming garden, cinematic shot"
</pre>
<p>Simply replace the example text with your desired prompt. The skill will generate a video based on your description.</p>
<h3>Image-to-Video Generation</h3>
<p>To animate a static image, use the following command (replace the example URL with your image&#8217;s URL):</p>
<pre>python3 scripts/generate.py "Camera slowly zooming in" --image-url https://example.com/image.jpg
</pre>
<p>You can also specify a local image file using the <code>--image-file</code> option instead of <code>--image-url</code>.</p>
<h2>Models and Pricing</h2>
<p>The SiliconFlow Video Generation skill uses the powerful Wan2.2 model (14B parameters) for both text-to-video and image-to-video generation. The pricing is straightforward and affordable:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wan-AI/Wan2.2-T2V-A14B (Text-to-Video)</strong>: ¥2 per video</li>
<li><strong>Wan-AI/Wan2.2-T2V-A14B (Image-to-Video)</strong>: ¥2 per video</li>
</ul>
<h2>Security Notes</h2>
<p>When using the SiliconFlow Video Generation skill, keep the following security considerations in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>The skill requires your SiliconFlow API key to function. Keep this key secure and avoid sharing it.</li>
<li>The script reads your OpenClaw configuration file (~/.openclaw/openclaw.json) only to auto-detect your API key. No other sensitive data is accessed.</li>
<li>No sensitive data is transmitted except to <code>api.siliconflow.cn</code>. All video generation requests are sent directly to SiliconFlow&#8217;s servers.</li>
<li><strong>Always review the code</strong> (available at <code>scripts/generate.py</code>) before providing your credentials. This ensures that you&#8217;re comfortable with how the skill handles your data.</li>
</ul>
