<h2>What is OGT Docs &#8211; Create Task?</h2>
<p>OGT Docs &#8211; Create Task is a comprehensive system for creating and managing tasks in a docs-first workflow. It provides a structured approach to task lifecycle management where each task is represented as a folder that moves through various workflow stages, accumulating documentation and signals as it progresses.</p>
<p>The system is designed to bring clarity, traceability, and organization to task management by treating documentation as the primary artifact of work. Instead of scattered notes or ephemeral conversations, every task maintains a complete history of its evolution from conception to completion.</p>
<h2>How OGT Docs &#8211; Create Task Works</h2>
<p>The system operates on a simple yet powerful principle: each task is a folder that moves through defined stages. This folder-based approach ensures that all related documentation stays together and can be easily tracked throughout the task&#8217;s lifecycle.</p>
<h3>Core Workflow Stages</h3>
<p>Tasks move through six primary stages:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>pending</strong> &#8211; Tasks that are defined but not yet started</li>
<li><strong>in_progress</strong> &#8211; Tasks being actively worked on</li>
<li><strong>review</strong> &#8211; Tasks completed and awaiting review</li>
<li><strong>blocked</strong> &#8211; Tasks that cannot proceed due to dependencies</li>
<li><strong>done</strong> &#8211; Completed and verified tasks</li>
<li><strong>rejected</strong> &#8211; Tasks that were declined</li>
</ol>
<p>Each stage has specific requirements and signals that indicate the task&#8217;s current state. The system uses empty files as signals &#8211; their presence indicates a particular state without requiring content.</p>
<h3>Folder Structure</h3>
<p>The complete folder structure looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>docs/todo/

<h2>Key Components of Each Task</h2>
<h3>task.md &#8211; The Primary Definition</h3>

<h2>Getting Started with OGT Docs &#8211; Create Task</h2>
<h3>Creating Your First Task</h3>
<p>Follow these steps to create your first task:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new folder in the appropriate stage (usually pending/)</li>
<li>Name the folder using a clear, descriptive slug (e.g., fuzzy_search)</li>
<li>Create task.md with all required sections</li>
<li>Add context.md if background information is needed</li>
<li>Create .version and .priority files</li>
</ol>
<h3>Moving Tasks Through Workflow</h3>
<p>As work progresses, move tasks through stages:</p>
<ol>
<li>When starting work, move from pending/ to in_progress/</li>
<li>Update progress.md with your work log</li>
<li>Create .assigned_to_{agent} and .started_at files</li>
<li>When complete, move to review/ and create implementation.md</li>
<li>Add .ready_for_review, .pr_link, and .review_requested_at</li>
<li>After review, move to done/ and create verification.md</li>
<li>Add .verified, .completed_at, and .verified_by_{agent}</li>
</ol>
<h2>Best Practices</h2>
<h3>Task Definition</h3>
<ul>
<li>Keep tasks focused and achievable</li>
<li>Write clear, specific objectives</li>
<li>Define measurable acceptance criteria</li>
<li>Identify dependencies early</li>
</ul>
<h3>Documentation Quality</h3>
<ul>
<li>Write for future readers, not just yourself</li>
<li>Use clear, concise language</li>
<li>Include links to relevant resources</li>

</ul>
<h2>Common Scenarios</h2>
<h3>Handling Blocks</h3>
<p>When a task cannot proceed due to dependencies:</p>
<ol>
<li>Move the task to blocked/</li>
