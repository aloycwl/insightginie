<h1>Introduction to WaveSpeed AI and OpenClaw</h1>
<p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of generative AI, having a unified interface to access cutting-edge models is no longer a luxury—it is a necessity. The OpenClaw project has introduced a powerful solution through the WaveSpeed AI skill, a comprehensive tool that bridges the gap between complex model deployments and user-friendly automation. By integrating over 700+ AI models from industry giants like Google, OpenAI, ByteDance, Kling, and Luma into a single, cohesive workflow, WaveSpeed simplifies how developers and creators handle multimedia generation.</p>
<h2>What Is the WaveSpeed Skill?</h2>
<p>The WaveSpeed skill is designed as a centralized gateway for AI-powered media creation. Whether you need to generate high-resolution images from text prompts, retouch professional portraits while maintaining identity, or transform static images into dynamic, cinematic videos, this skill handles it all. Instead of juggling multiple subscriptions and fragmented APIs, users of OpenClaw can utilize a singular, robust toolchain to execute complex media tasks via simple command-line prompts.</p>
<h2>Key Functionalities and Capabilities</h2>
<p>The versatility of the WaveSpeed skill lies in its extensive model library. Below is a breakdown of what you can achieve with this tool:</p>
<h3>1. Advanced Image Generation</h3>
<p>The skill supports top-tier image models such as FLUX, Seedream, and Qwen. Users can generate everything from quick drafts using the lightning-fast <code>flux-schnell</code> model to production-grade masterpieces using <code>flux-pro</code>. With just a simple command, you can specify dimensions, styles, and themes, turning abstract text prompts into pixel-perfect reality in under two seconds.</p>
<h3>2. Identity-Preserving Photo Editing</h3>
<p>One of the most impressive features is the integration of the <code>nano-banana-pro</code> model. Unlike standard editing tools that might distort facial features during alteration, this specific model is optimized to keep faces identical while allowing for complex modifications like changing outfits, altering backgrounds, or retouching lighting. This makes it an essential tool for digital marketing, character design, and personalized content creation.</p>
<h3>3. From Static to Cinematic: Video Generation</h3>
<p>WaveSpeed isn&#8217;t limited to still images. It excels at video production, supporting powerful models like Kling, Veo, Sora, and Wan. You can convert text prompts into full stories or use an existing image as a reference to create a video, effectively animating your photographic content. The script supports upscaling to 4K, ensuring your video assets meet professional broadcast standards.</p>
<h2>Setting Up Your Environment</h2>
<p>The beauty of the OpenClaw implementation is its focus on developer efficiency. To get started, the system looks for an environment variable named <code>WAVESPEED_API_KEY</code>. In many pre-configured Clawster containers, this is already handled for you. For new users, obtaining an API key is a straightforward process: simply head to the WaveSpeed dashboard, generate your credentials, and export them into your environment. The system&#8217;s design philosophy is &#8216;do not search for the key&#8217;—if it is set in your workspace, the tools are ready to operate immediately.</p>
<h2>Practical Usage Examples</h2>
<p>To give you a better understanding of how the command-line interface (CLI) works, consider these practical scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Generating an Image:</strong> <code>node wavespeed.js generate --model flux --prompt "sunset over mountains" --output sunset.png</code>. This simple command triggers the FLUX model and saves the file directly to your directory.</li>
<li><strong>Retouching a Photo:</strong> By using the <code>nbp</code> alias, you can safely modify clothing or backgrounds while ensuring the subject remains recognizable. The system requires an <code>images</code> array, ensuring the AI has a clear visual reference to preserve the subject&#8217;s identity.</li>
<li><strong>Creating Video:</strong> Using the <code>wan-i2v</code> model, you can take a still image and request a &#8220;slow cinematic zoom,&#8221; turning a static landscape into a professional-grade video clip in just a few minutes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why Choose WaveSpeed for Your AI Workflow?</h2>
<p>The primary advantage of the WaveSpeed skill within OpenClaw is the significant reduction in friction. AI generation often requires navigating disparate websites, handling different output formats, and managing varying API documentation styles. WaveSpeed abstracts this complexity. By providing a unified command structure, it allows developers to focus on the &#8216;what&#8217; and &#8216;why&#8217; of their creative projects rather than the &#8216;how&#8217;.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the polling mechanism built into the video generation scripts ensures that long-running tasks—which can take 2-5 minutes—are tracked with progress indicators. You never have to guess if the process has hung or if it is still working; the CLI provides real-time feedback until your high-quality video file is ready.</p>
<h2>Model Reference and Performance</h2>
<p>For users who want to push the boundaries, the <code>models</code> command allows you to list all available aliases. This transparency is crucial for high-level projects where selecting the correct model can make the difference between a draft-quality image and a final, portfolio-ready render. Whether you prioritize speed for prototyping or quality for final output, there is an alias tailored to your specific needs.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The WaveSpeed AI skill is a vital addition to the OpenClaw ecosystem, effectively democratizing access to high-end generative models. By integrating photo editing, image generation, and video synthesis into one tool, it empowers creators to build complex media pipelines without leaving the comfort of their command line. If you are looking to integrate high-speed AI capabilities into your projects, exploring the <code>wavespeed.js</code> documentation and starting your first generation task is the perfect next step. Embrace the future of creative automation today.</p>
