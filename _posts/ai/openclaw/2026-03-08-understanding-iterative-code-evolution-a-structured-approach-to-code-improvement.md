<h2>What Is Iterative Code Evolution?</h2>
<p>Iterative Code Evolution is a structured methodology for improving code through disciplined <strong>reflect → mutate → verify → score</strong> cycles, adapted from the ALMA (Automated meta-Learning of Memory designs for Agentic systems) research framework. This approach replaces ad-hoc &#8220;try and fix&#8221; with systematic analysis, variant tracking, and principled selection of what to change next.</p>
<h2>When to Use This Skill</h2>
<p>Use Iterative Code Evolution when you need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Iterate on code that isn&#8217;t working well enough (performance, correctness, design)</li>
<li>Optimize an implementation across multiple rounds of changes</li>
<li>Debug persistent or recurring issues where simple fixes keep failing</li>
<li>Evolve a system design through structured experimentation</li>
<li>Work on any task where you&#8217;ve already tried 2+ approaches and need discipline about what to try next</li>
<li>Build or improve prompts, pipelines, agents, or any &#8220;program&#8221; that benefits from iterative refinement</li>
</ul>
<h2>When NOT to Use This Skill</h2>
<p>Avoid this approach for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple one-shot code generation (just write it)</li>
<li>Mechanical tasks with clear solutions (refactoring, formatting, migrations)</li>
<li>When the user has already specified exactly what to change</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Evolution Loop</h2>
<p>Every improvement cycle follows this structured sequence:</p>
<pre><code> ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
 │  1. ANALYZE  — structured diagnosis of current code │
 │  2. PLAN     — prioritized, concrete changes        │
 │  3. MUTATE   — implement the changes                │
 │  4. VERIFY   — run it, check for errors             │
 │  5. SCORE    — measure improvement vs. baseline     │
 │  6. ARCHIVE  — log what was tried and what happened │
 │                                                     │
 │  Loop back to 1 with new knowledge                  │
 └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
</code></pre>
<h2>The Evolution Log</h2>
<p>Track all iterations in <code>.evolution/log.json</code> at the project root. This memory makes each cycle smarter than the last:</p>
<pre><code>{
  "baseline": {
    "description": "Initial implementation before evolution began",
    "score": 0.0,
    "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z"
  },
  "variants": {
    "v001": {
      "parent": "baseline",
      "description": "Added input validation and error handling",
      "changes_made": [
        {
          "what": "Added type checks on all public methods",
          "why": "Runtime crashes from malformed input in 3/10 test cases",
          "priority": "High"
        }
      ],
      "score": 0.6,
      "delta": "+0.6 vs parent",
      "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "learned": "Input validation was the primary failure mode — most other logic was sound"
    }
  },
  "principles_learned": [
    "Input validation fixes give the biggest early gains",
    "Regex-based parsing breaks on recursive structures — prefer state machines",
    "Small targeted changes score better than large rewrites"
  ]
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Phase 1: ANALYZE — Structured Diagnosis</h2>
<p>Before changing anything, perform a structured analysis of the current code and its outputs. This is the most important phase — it prevents wasted mutations.</p>
<h3>Step 1 — Learn from past edits</h3>
<p>(skip on first iteration)</p>
<p>Review the evolution log. For each previous change:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did the score improve or degrade?</li>
<li>What pattern made it succeed or fail?</li>
<li>Extract 2-3 principles to adopt and 2-3 pitfalls to avoid</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 2 — Component-level assessment</h3>
<p>For each meaningful component (function, class, module, pipeline stage), label it:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Label</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Working</td>
<td>Produces correct output, no issues observed</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fragile</td>
<td>Works on happy path but fails on edge cases or specific inputs</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Broken</td>
<td>Produces wrong output or errors</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Redundant</td>
<td>Duplicates logic found elsewhere, adds complexity without value</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Missing</td>
<td>A needed component that doesn&#8217;t exist yet</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>For each label, write a one-line explanation of <strong>why</strong> — linked to specific test outputs or observed behavior.</p>
<h3>Step 3 — Quality and coherence check</h3>
<p>Look for cross-cutting issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data flow</strong>: Do components pass structured data to each other, or rely on implicit state?</li>
<li><strong>Error handling</strong>: Are errors caught and handled, or silently swallowed?</li>
<li><strong>Duplication</strong>: Is the same logic repeated in multiple places?</li>
<li><strong>Hardcoding</strong>: Are there magic numbers, hardcoded paths, or environment-specific assumptions?</li>
<li><strong>Generalization</strong>: Which parts would work on new inputs vs. which are overfitted to test cases?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 4 — Produce prioritized suggestions</h3>
<p>Based on Steps 1-3, produce concrete changes. Each suggestion must have:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PRIORITY</strong>: High | Medium | Low</li>
<li><strong>WHAT</strong>: Precise description of the change (code-level, not vague)</li>
<li><strong>WHY</strong>: Link to a specific observation from Steps 1-3</li>
<li><strong>RISK</strong>: What could go wrong if this change is made incorrectly</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rule: Every suggestion must link to an observation.</strong></p>
<p>No &#8220;this might help&#8221; suggestions — only changes grounded in something you actually saw in the code or outputs.</p>
<p><strong>Rule: Limit to 3 suggestions per cycle.</strong></p>
<p>More than 3 changes at once makes it impossible to attribute improvement or regression to specific changes.</p>
<h2>Phase 2: PLAN — Select What to Change</h2>
<p>Pick 1-3 suggestions from the analysis. Selection principles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>High priority first</strong> — fix broken things before optimizing working things</li>
<li><strong>One theme per cycle</strong> — don&#8217;t mix unrelated changes (e.g., don&#8217;t fix parsing AND refactor error handling in the same mutation)</li>
<li><strong>Prefer targeted over sweeping</strong> — a surgical change to one function beats a rewrite of three modules</li>
<li><strong>If stuck, explore</strong> — if the last 2+ cycles showed diminishing returns on the same component, pick a different component to modify (this is the ALMA &#8220;visit penalty&#8221; principle — don&#8217;t keep grinding on the same thing)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Phase 3: MUTATE — Implement Changes</h2>
<p>Write the new code. Key discipline:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change only what the plan says.</li>
<li>Resist the urge to &#8220;fix one more thing&#8221; while you&#8217;re in there.</li>
<li>Preserve interfaces. Don&#8217;t change function signatures or return types unless the plan explicitly calls for it.</li>
<li>Comment the rationale. Add a brief comment near each change referencing the evolution cycle (e.g., <code># evo-v003: switched to state machine per edge case failures</code>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Phase 4: VERIFY — Run and Check</h2>
<p>Execute the modified code against the same inputs/tests used for scoring.</p>
<p>If it crashes (up to 3 retries):</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the reflection-fix protocol:
<ul>
<li>Read the full error traceback</li>
<li>Identify the <strong>root cause</strong> (not the symptom)</li>
<li>Fix <strong>only</strong> the root cause — do not make unrelated improvements</li>
<li>Re-run</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After 3 failed retries, <strong>revert to parent variant</strong> and log the failure:</p>
<pre><code>{
  "attempted": "Description of what was tried",
  "failure_mode": "The error that occurred",
  "root_cause": "The actual issue (not the symptom)",
  "reverted_to": "Parent variant name",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T12:00:00Z"
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Phase 5: SCORE — Measure Improvement</h2>
<p>Score the new variant against the baseline or parent variant using a consistent metric:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Correctness</strong>: % of test cases passing</li>
<li><strong>Performance</strong>: Runtime, memory usage, or other relevant metrics</li>
<li><strong>Quality</strong>: Code complexity, readability, or maintainability scores</li>
</ul>
<p>Record the score as a number (0.0-1.0 for normalized metrics, or raw values for specific measurements).</p>
<h2>Phase 6: ARCHIVE — Log What Happened</h2>
<p>Update <code>.evolution/log.json</code> with the new variant, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Description of changes made</li>
<li>Score achieved</li>
<li>Delta vs parent</li>
<li>What was learned from this iteration</li>
</ul>
<h2>Core Principles</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Evidence-based changes</strong>: Every mutation must be grounded in observed behavior, not speculation.</li>
<li><strong>Small, focused iterations</strong>: Change one thing at a time to understand what works.</li>
<li><n

<li><strong>Systematic learning</strong>: Extract principles from each cycle to guide future changes.</li>
<li><strong>Failure as data</strong>: When changes fail, understand why and update your mental model.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Benefits of This Approach</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reduced wasted effort</strong>: No more &#8220;fixing&#8221; code without understanding the problem.</li>
<li><strong>Better debugging</strong>: Systematic diagnosis finds root causes faster.</li>
<li><strong>Improved code quality</strong>: Each iteration builds on verified improvements.</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge accumulation</strong>: The evolution log becomes a valuable resource for future work.</li>
<li><strong>Team collaboration</strong>: Structured logs make it easier for teams to understand why code evolved the way it did.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Real-World Example</h2>
<p>Consider a function that parses CSV data but fails on certain edge cases. Using Iterative Code Evolution:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>ANALYZE</strong>: Test with various inputs, identify that it fails on quoted fields containing commas.</li>
<li><strong>PLAN</strong>: Decide to replace simple split-based parsing with a state machine approach.</li>
<li><strong>MUTATE</strong>: Implement the state machine, preserving the function interface.</li>
<li><strong>VERIFY</strong>: Test with the original failing cases plus new edge cases.</li>
<li><strong>SCORE</strong>: Measure success rate (e.g., 95% to 100% of test cases passing).</li>
<li><strong>ARCHIVE</strong>: Log the change, score, and principle learned (&#8220;State machines handle quoted field edge cases better than split-based approaches&#8221;).</li>
</ol>
<p>The next time you encounter CSV parsing issues, you&#8217;ll know exactly what approach worked before and why.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Iterative Code Evolution transforms code improvement from trial-and-error into a systematic, learnable process. By following the structured cycle of analyze, plan, mutate, verify, score, and archive, you&#8217;ll solve problems more efficiently, build better code, and accumulate valuable knowledge that makes each subsequent iteration smarter than the last.</p>
<p>The key is discipline: resist the urge to make multiple changes at once, always ground your changes in observed evidence, and treat failures as learning opportunities rather than setbacks. With practice, this approach becomes second nature and dramatically improves your effectiveness as a developer.</p>
