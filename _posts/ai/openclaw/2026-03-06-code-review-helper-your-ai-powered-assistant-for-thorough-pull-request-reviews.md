<h2>What is Code Review Helper?</h2>
<p>Code Review Helper is an AI-powered code review assistant that generates comprehensive review checklists tailored to the file types in your pull request. It automates the tedious parts of code review by scanning changed files and producing file-type-specific checklists with built-in checks for security, performance, style, and testing best practices.</p>
<p>This OpenClaw skill helps reviewers be thorough and consistent, reducing the chance of overlooked issues reaching production. Whether you&#8217;re a senior developer conducting reviews or a team lead establishing review standards, Code Review Helper ensures nothing falls through the cracks.</p>
<h2>How Code Review Helper Works</h2>
<p>The tool analyzes the diff between your current branch and main (or a specified base branch) and generates a comprehensive review checklist. It works by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Scanning changed files to identify their types and technologies</li>
<li>Applying language-specific security, performance, style, and test checks</li>
<li>Generating severity-based reports with critical, warning, and info level items</li>
<li>Creating ready-to-use PR review templates for GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket</li>
</ol>
<p>The skill runs entirely in your local environment and requires git (version 2.0+), bash (version 4.0+), and standard Unix utilities like awk, grep, sed, sort, and wc. It&#8217;s compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows via Git Bash, WSL, or MSYS2.</p>
<h2>Installation and Setup</h2>
<p>Installing Code Review Helper is straightforward through ClawHub:</p>
<pre><code>openclaw install code-review-helper
</code></pre>
<p>For manual installation, copy the skill to your OpenClaw skills directory:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir -p ~/.openclaw/skills/
cp -r code-review-helper/ ~/.openclaw/skills/
chmod +x ~/.openclaw/skills/code-review-helper/scripts/review.sh
openclaw list --installed
</code></pre>
<h2>Core Features and Capabilities</h2>
<h3>Security Checks</h3>
<p>The security module scans for common vulnerabilities and risky patterns across all major programming languages. It identifies hardcoded secrets and tokens (critical severity), SQL injection patterns, command injection vulnerabilities, insecure deserialization, and missing input validation. The tool also checks for unsafe regex patterns, HTTP instead of HTTPS usage, disabled security headers, eval/exec usage, weak cryptography, missing CSRF protection, and verbose error messages that could leak sensitive information.</p>
<h3>Performance Checks</h3>
<p>The performance module identifies potential bottlenecks before they impact production. It detects N+1 query patterns that can cripple database performance, missing database indexes, unbounded list operations that could cause memory issues, synchronous I/O in async code, large objects in memory, missing pagination, redundant re-computation, unoptimized imports, and string concatenation in loops.</p>
<h3>Style Consistency Checks</h3>
<p>Code Review Helper enforces consistency across your codebase with checks for inconsistent naming conventions, mixed tabs and spaces, import ordering (for Python and JavaScript), line length violations, missing docstrings (Python), dead code or unused variables, TODO/FIXME/HACK comments that should be addressed, and magic numbers that should be replaced with named constants.</p>
<h3>Test Coverage Verification</h3>
<p>The test module verifies adequate coverage for new code changes. It checks for no tests for new functions, missing edge case tests, mocking external services appropriately, assert count per test, test naming conventions, and whether integration tests are present for the changes.</p>
<h2>Command-Line Options and Flexibility</h2>
<p>Code Review Helper offers extensive customization through command-line options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Branch comparison</strong>: Specify base and head branches with &#8211;base and &#8211;head options</li>
<li><strong>File filtering</strong>: Use &#8211;files with glob patterns to review specific directories or file types</li>
<li><strong>Category selection</strong>: Run security-only, performance-only, style-only, or test-only checks</li>
<li><strong>Severity filtering</strong>: Set minimum severity level (critical, warning, info) to focus on the most important issues</li>
<li><strong>Output formats</strong>: Choose between markdown (default), JSON, or plain text output</li>
<li><strong>Output destinations</strong>: Write results to a file instead of stdout with &#8211;output-file</li>
<li><strong>PR review templates</strong>: Generate ready-to-use templates in minimal, standard, or thorough styles</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of common usage patterns include reviewing changes between specific branches, running security-only reviews with critical severity, reviewing specific file patterns, generating JSON reports for automation, reviewing specific PRs by number, and generating thorough review templates.</p>
<h2>PR Review Templates</h2>
<p>One of the most powerful features is the ability to generate ready-to-use PR review templates. Three template styles are available:</p>
<p><strong>Minimal</strong>: Quick reviews for small changes with basic correctness, security, and test pass checks.</p>
<p><strong>Standard</strong>: Balanced review for typical PRs covering correctness, security, performance, tests, and notes sections.</p>
<p><strong>Thorough</strong>: Deep review for critical changes including all standard sections plus architecture, documentation, deployment, and rollback considerations.</p>
<p>Generate a template with: <code>openclaw run code-review-helper --template --template-style thorough</code></p>
<h2>Integration with CI/CD Pipelines</h2>
<p>Code Review Helper integrates seamlessly with your CI/CD pipeline to automate review checks. You can add automated review checks to your GitHub Actions workflow that run the review, fail the build if critical issues are found, and post review comments to the PR. The script exits with code 1 if any critical-severity issues are found, which will fail the CI step and block the merge until issues are resolved.</p>
<p>This integration ensures that every PR undergoes consistent automated review before merging, catching issues early in the development process.</p>
<h2>Language Support</h2>
<p>Code Review Helper provides comprehensive support across major programming languages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Python</strong>: Full security, performance, style, and test coverage</li>
<li><strong>JavaScript/TypeScript</strong>: Full security, performance, style, and test coverage</li>
