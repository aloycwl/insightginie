<h1>Understanding OpenClaw Skill: Queue-Task for Efficient Batch Processing</h1>
</header>
<section>
<h2>Introduction to OpenClaw Queue-Task Skill</h2>
<p>The OpenClaw Queue-Task skill is a powerful tool designed to streamline batch job processing. It simplifies the management of long-running queue jobs by ensuring they are durable, resumable, and idempotent. This means it can handle tasks that may be interrupted or need to be restarted without losing progress or causing duplicate work.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of the Queue-Task skill is to manage Jobs inside a task folder structure, maintaining state files and ensuring that tasks can be resumed from where they left off, even if they fail or are interrupted. It is particularly useful for large-scale batch processing jobs that need to be run in smaller, manageable chunks.</p>

<h2>Key Components of OpenClaw Queue-Task Skill</h2>
<p>The Queue-Task skill is designed to work within a specific directory structure, known as the &#8220;task-father&#8221; layout. This structure includes several State files that help track the progress and state of batch jobs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>queue.jsonl:</strong> This file contains the list of jobs waiting to be processed.</li>
<li><strong>progress.json:</strong> This file keeps track of the current progress of the batch job, updating after each item is processed.</li>
<li><strong>done.jsonl:</strong> This file logs the jobs that have been successfully completed.</li>
<li><strong>failed.jsonl:</strong> This file records any jobs that failed during processing.</li>
<li><strong>lock.json:</strong> This file ensures that only one instance of the task is running at a time, preventing concurrent runs that could lead to data corruption.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Prerequisites and Configuration</h2>
<p>Before using the Queue-Task skill, certain prerequisites must be met. The skill requires Python 3 and access to the OpenClaw CLI. The configuration involves setting up environment variables that define the workspace and task directories, batch size, lock timeouts, and scheduling parameters.</p>
<p>The configuration is managed through a config.env file, which includes the following keys:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>WORKSPACE_DIR:</strong> The root directory where task folders will be located.</li>
<li><strong>TASKS_DIR:</strong> The subdirectory within the workspace where tasks are stored.</li>
<li><strong>BATCH_SIZE:</strong> The number of jobs to process in each batch.</li>
<li><strong>LOCK_STALE_MINUTES:</strong> The time after which a stale lock is considered invalid.</li>
<li><strong>CRON_EXPR:</strong> The cron expression used to schedule the task.</li>
<li><strong>CRON_TZ:</strong> The timezone for the cron schedule.</li>
<li><strong>DELIVERY_MODE:</strong> The method used to deliver the task jobs.</li>
<li><strong>AGENT_ID:</strong> A unique identifier for the agent running the task.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Initialization and Installation</h2>
<p>To start using the Queue-Task skill, it is recommended to use a chat-first approach. This involves providing the task slug, batch size, lock stale minutes, and schedule details, followed by initializing the task with a simple command:</p>
<p><code>python3 scripts/queue_task.py init <slug></code></p>
<p>After initialization, you can perform a smoke test to ensure everything is set up correctly by running:</p>
<p><code>python3 scripts/queue_task.py status <slug></code></p>
<p>For more advanced users, there is an optional terminal approach where you can manually copy and edit the config.env file before running the initialization commands.</p>
</section>

<h2>Commands and Usage Notes</h2>
<p>The Queue-Task skill comes with several commands that allow you to manage tasks efficiently:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Init files:</strong> <code>python3 scripts/queue_task.py init <slug></code></li>
<li><strong>Status:</strong> <code>python3 scripts/queue_task.py status <slug></code></li>
<li><strong>Clear stale lock:</strong> <code>python3 scripts/queue_task.py clear-stale-lock <slug></code></li>
<li><strong>Print worker template:</strong> <code>python3 scripts/queue_task.py print-supervisor-template</code></li>
</ul>
<p>When using the Queue-Task skill, it is recommended to adhere to the following best practices:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Append-only JSONL logs:</strong> Use JSON Lines (JSONL) format for logs to ensure they are easily parseable and appendable.</li>
<li><strong>Process small batches:</strong> Keep the batch size small to minimize the impact of a single task failure.</li>
<li><strong>Update progress.json:</strong> Regularly update the progress file to reflect the current state of the batch job.</li>
<li><strong>Keep idempotency keys task-defined:</strong> Ensure that jobs are idempotent, meaning they can be retried without causing duplicate work.</li>
<li><strong>Use lock file:</strong> Leverage the lock file to prevent concurrent runs of the same task.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The OpenClaw Queue-Task skill is an invaluable tool for anyone dealing with large-scale batch processing jobs. By providing a durable, resumable, and idempotent framework, it ensures that tasks can be managed efficiently and reliably. Whether you are processing data, running scripts, or managing workflows, the Queue-Task skill can help streamline your operations and enhance productivity.</p>
