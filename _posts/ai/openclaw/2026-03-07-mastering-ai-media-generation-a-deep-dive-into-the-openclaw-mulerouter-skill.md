<h1>Introduction to the MuleRouter Skill in OpenClaw</h1>
<p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, the ability to bridge the gap between complex multimodal models and user-friendly interfaces is paramount. The OpenClaw ecosystem has introduced a powerful tool known as the MuleRouter skill. This specialized skill is designed to act as a bridge between the OpenClaw environment and robust multimodal APIs, specifically MuleRouter and MuleRun, enabling users to generate, edit, and transform high-quality images and videos through a command-line interface.</p>
<h2>What is the MuleRouter Skill?</h2>
<p>At its core, the MuleRouter skill is an integration layer that leverages state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative AI models. Whether you are looking to perform text-to-image synthesis, text-to-video generation, image-to-video manipulation, or advanced video editing tasks like keyframe interpolation, this skill provides the necessary structure to communicate with services like Wan2.6, Veo3, Nano Banana Pro, Sora2, and Midjourney.</p>
<p>By utilizing this skill, developers and creators can bypass the manual complexity of interacting with proprietary AI APIs. Instead, they can utilize a standardized, modular environment managed by Python and the <code>uv</code> dependency manager, ensuring that the heavy lifting of API authentication and request management is handled automatically.</p>
<h2>Setting Up Your Environment</h2>
<p>Before you can begin generating AI content, you must ensure your environment is correctly configured. The MuleRouter skill is built for precision, requiring specific environment variables to maintain security and connectivity. To get started, you will need an API key from your preferred provider (MuleRouter or MuleRun). The skill relies on two primary configuration variables: <code>MULEROUTER_API_KEY</code> and either <code>MULEROUTER_BASE_URL</code> or <code>MULEROUTER_SITE</code>.</p>
<p>A critical tip for security is to avoid using shell <code>export</code> commands for your credentials. Instead, the developers highly recommend creating a <code>.env</code> file within the working directory. The skill is specifically designed to parse only those variables prefixed with <code>MULEROUTER_</code>, providing a clean and secure method to manage your setup. To verify your configuration, simply use the built-in diagnostic command: <code>uv run python -c "from core.config import load_config; load_config(); print('Configuration OK')"</code>.</p>
<h2>Workflow and Dependency Management</h2>
<p>The OpenClaw team has prioritized efficiency by utilizing <code>uv</code>, a high-performance Python package manager. The workflow for using the MuleRouter skill is straightforward yet highly robust. After verifying your environment variables, you should run <code>uv sync</code> to install all necessary dependencies. Once the environment is ready, the discovery phase begins.</p>
<p>Users can list available models using <code>uv run python scripts/list_models.py</code>. This command is particularly useful because it displays model tags, such as [SOTA], which helps users identify the most powerful and reliable models currently available. If you aren&#8217;t sure which model fits your creative vision, the skill architecture is built to support interactive prompts, allowing you to present options to a user or select the best fit based on specific project requirements.</p>
<h2>Performing Advanced AI Tasks</h2>
<p>Once you have identified the model you wish to use, executing tasks becomes a matter of running specific python scripts provided within the skill structure. For instance, generating a video from a prompt is as simple as: <code>uv run python models/alibaba/wan2.6-t2v/generation.py --prompt "A cat walking through a garden"</code>.</p>
<p>The skill also excels at image-to-video (I2V) tasks. It allows users to provide local image paths rather than relying on cumbersome base64 strings. The system includes built-in path validation, ensuring that only recognized image formats (such as .png, .jpg, .heic, and .webp) are accepted. This design choice prevents command-line length limits and ensures a smooth, professional workflow.</p>
<h2>Best Practices for Success</h2>
<p>When working with large-scale generative models, timeout management is essential. The MuleRouter skill is optimized for heavy computational tasks, but users should be mindful of the time required for inference. For image generation, a timeout of 5 minutes is generally sufficient, while video generation tasks may require up to 15 minutes depending on the complexity of the prompt and the model selected.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when in doubt, lean on the model metadata. The <code>--list-params</code> command is your best friend when exploring new models. By running <code>uv run python models/<path>/<action>.py --list-params</code>, you gain a clear understanding of the specific input parameters each model accepts, allowing for fine-tuned control over style, aspect ratio, and creative output.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The OpenClaw MuleRouter skill is more than just a wrapper; it is a comprehensive productivity tool that brings professional-grade AI media generation into the reach of any developer or hobbyist using the OpenClaw platform. By standardizing the interface for models like Wan2.6 and Veo3, it removes the technical barriers to entry and allows users to focus on what matters most: the creative result. If you are looking to integrate advanced AI video and image capabilities into your workflow, this skill is the definitive starting point.</p>
