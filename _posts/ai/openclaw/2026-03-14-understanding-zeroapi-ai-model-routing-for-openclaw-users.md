<h1>Understanding ZeroAPI: AI Model Routing for OpenClaw Users</h1>
<p>In the ever-evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, managing multiple AI models across different subscriptions can be a daunting task. Enter <strong>ZeroAPI</strong>, a skill designed for the <strong>OpenClaw</strong> framework that streamlines the process of routing tasks to the most suitable AI model. This article delves into what ZeroAPI does, its capabilities, and how it can enhance productivity.</p>
<h2>What is ZeroAPI?</h2>
<p>ZeroAPI is a skill designed for the <a href="https://github.com/openclaw/skills">OpenClaw</a> platform, which functions as a gateway for routing tasks to the best AI model based on the user&#8217;s available subscriptions. It supports models such as <strong>Claude</strong>, <strong>ChatGPT</strong>, <strong>Codex</strong>, <strong>Gemini</strong>, and <strong>Kimi</strong>. The primary goal of ZeroAPI is to optimize task delegation by selecting the most appropriate AI model for each specific task, thereby enhancing efficiency and output quality.</p>
<h2>Key Features of ZeroAPI</h2>
<h3>Model Routing</h3>
<p>ZeroAPI intelligently routes tasks to the best AI model based on the task type and the user&#8217;s available subscriptions. For example, if a task requires complex reasoning and planning, ZeroAPI might delegate it to Claude Opus, which excels in these areas. Conversely, if a task is a quick formatting request, it might be routed to Gemini Flash-Lite, which offers low-latency responses.</p>
<h3>Conflict Resolution</h3>
<p>In scenarios where multiple models could handle a task, ZeroAPI has a built-in conflict resolution mechanism. This ensures that tasks are delegated to the most suitable model based on predefined priority rules. For example, judgment tasks are given priority over speed, ensuring that complex or ambiguous tasks are handled by the most capable model.</p>
<h3>Sub-Agent Delegation</h3>
<p>ZeroAPI leverages OpenClaw&#8217;s agent system to delegate tasks to sub-agents. This allows for a more granular level of task management and delegation. Users can specify which agent to use for a particular task, ensuring that the task is handled by the most appropriate model.</p>
<h3>Provider Configuration</h3>
<p>ZeroAPI supports configuration of multiple AI providers. Users can specify which providers they have access to, and ZeroAPI will route tasks accordingly. This flexibility allows users to leverage the best features of each model, optimizing overall performance.</p>
<h2>Use Cases for ZeroAPI</h2>
<h3>Code Writing and Review</h3>
<p>ZeroAPI can route code writing tasks to Codex, which is optimal for code generation. For code review and architectural analysis, it can delegate to Claude Opus, which has a higher intelligence score and better judgment capabilities.</p>
<h3>Research and Analysis</h3>
<p>For research tasks, ZeroAPI can delegate to Gemini Pro, which has a high GPQA score and is optimized for scientific research and long context analysis. For tasks requiring structured output, it can use Gemini Flash, which has a high IFBench score.</p>
<h3>Quick Tasks and Pings</h4>
<p>For tasks that require quick responses, such as format conversions or translations, ZeroAPI can route to Gemini Flash-Lite, which offers low-latency responses. For more complex tasks, it can delegate to higher-tier models like Gemini Pro or Claude Opus.</p>
<h2>First-Time Setup</h2>
<p>When setting up ZeroAPI for the first time, users need to determine their available providers. This involves mapping subscriptions to available tiers and confirming the active configuration. If only Claude is available, all tasks will stay on Opus, although the conflict resolution and collaboration patterns will still apply.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>ZeroAPI is a powerful skill for the OpenClaw platform that enhances productivity by intelligently routing tasks to the most suitable AI model. Its advanced features, such as model routing, conflict resolution, sub-agent delegation, and provider configuration, make it an invaluable tool for anyone working with multiple AI models. By leveraging ZeroAPI, users can optimize their workflow and ensure that each task is handled by the best available model.</p>
