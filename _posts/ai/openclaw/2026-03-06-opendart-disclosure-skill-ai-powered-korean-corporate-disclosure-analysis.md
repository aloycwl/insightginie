<h2>What is the OpenDART Disclosure Skill?</h2>
<p>The OpenDART Disclosure skill is an advanced AI-powered tool designed to access, analyze, and summarize corporate disclosures from Korea&#8217;s Electronic Disclosure System (DART). This skill leverages the OpenDART API to provide users with real-time access to financial reports, regulatory filings, and corporate announcements from Korean companies.</p>
<p>OpenDART (Open Data Analysis &amp; Retrieval of Transparency) is the official public data portal operated by the Financial Supervisory Service of Korea. It provides comprehensive access to corporate disclosures, financial statements, and regulatory reports filed by companies listed on Korean stock exchanges.</p>
<h2>How the OpenDART Disclosure Skill Works</h2>
<p>The skill operates through a streamlined workflow that combines AI capabilities with direct API integration. Here&#8217;s a breakdown of its functionality:</p>
<h3>Input Collection and Processing</p>
<p>The skill begins by collecting essential inputs from users:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Company Identifier</strong>: Users can provide either a corp_code (preferred) or company name</li>
<li><strong>Date Range</strong>: Specified using bgn_de and end_de parameters in YYYYMMDD format</li>
<li><strong>Filing Type Filters</strong>: Optional filters for regular reports (A), major issues (B), shares (C), etc.</li>
<li><strong>Desired Output</strong>: Users can request latest N items, only links, or short summaries</li>
</ul>
<h3>Company Identity Resolution</h3>
<p>The skill employs a sophisticated company identification process:</p>
<ol>
<li>If users provide a corp_code, it&#8217;s used directly for API queries</li>
<li>If only a company name is given, the skill runs the search-corp script to find matching companies</li>
<li>The system handles fuzzy matching and can show multiple candidates if several companies have similar names</li>
</ol>
<h3>Data Retrieval and Processing</h3>
<p>Once the company is identified, the skill:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pulls disclosures using the recent command</li>
<li>Sorts results by latest filing date</li>
<li>Applies user-specified filters and limits</li>
<li>Extracts key information including filing date, report name, receipt number, and OpenDART link</li>
</ol>
<h3>AI-Powered Analysis and Summarization</h3>
