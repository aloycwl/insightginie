<h1>Unlocking Efficient Content Creation with the Content3 Skill: A Complete Guide</h1>
<p>In today’s fast‑paced digital landscape, creators, marketers, and educators need tools that can produce high‑quality content at scale while reducing manual effort. The <strong>Content3 skill</strong>—an OpenClaw integration that taps into the Content3 API—delivers exactly that. It automates short‑form video generation, streamlines content library management, enables human‑in‑the‑loop reviews, and creates AI‑powered social media drafts ready for publishing. This article explains what the skill does, how it works, real‑world use cases, and the tangible benefits you can expect.</p>
<h2>What Is the Content3 Skill?</h2>
<p>The Content3 skill is a pre‑built OpenClaw skill that wraps the <a href="https://content3.app/developers" target="_blank">Content3 Agent API</a>. It provides a single, consistent interface for four core capabilities:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Short‑Form Video Generation</strong>: Turn prompts, Reddit threads, Quora answers, or raw text into polished videos with selectable voices and aspect ratios.</li>
<li><strong>Content Library Management</strong>: List, retrieve, and organize video assets, PDFs, images, slides, and markdown files.</li>
<li><strong>Human Review Workflow</strong>: Submit content for human approval, track revisions, and promote approved items to the library.</li>
<li><strong>Social Media Draft Creation</strong>: Generate AI‑crafted captions, hashtags, and platform‑specific drafts, then publish directly to TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, Pinterest, Threads, and more.</li>
</ol>
<p>All of these actions are performed via simple <code>curl</code> commands or programmatic HTTP calls, with authentication handled through a bearer token generated from an API key.</p>
<h2>How the Content3 Skill Works – Step‑by‑Step</h2>
<p>Below is a practical walkthrough of the skill’s workflow, from setup to publishing.</p>
<h3>1. Setup and Authentication</h3>
<p>First, you create an API key in the Content3 dashboard (<code>Settings → API Keys → Create API Key</code>). The key begins with <code>c3ak_</code> and is stored locally, for example:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir -p ~/.config/content3
cat &gt; ~/.config/content3/api_key &lt;&lt;EOF
c3ak_your_key_here
EOF</code></pre>
<p>All subsequent requests include the header <code>Authorization: Bearer $C3_KEY</code>. You can verify the key with <code>GET /v1/me</code>, which returns your user ID, key ID, and the scopes assigned to the key.</p>
<h3>2. Generate a Short‑Form Video</h3>
<p>The skill supports four source types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prompt</strong>: Provide a textual prompt and let the AI script the video.</li>
<li><strong>Reddit</strong>: Supply a Reddit post URL; the agent extracts the discussion and creates a script.</li>
<li><strong>Quora</strong>: Provide a Quora answer URL for similar processing.</li>
<li><strong>Raw Text</strong>: Upload a pre‑written script.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example request (prompt source):</p>
<pre><code>curl -X POST "https://api.content3.app/v1/agents/short-form/generate" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $C3_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "source": {"type": "prompt", "prompt": "Explain why cats always land on their feet"},
    "voiceId": "Kore",
    "aspectRatio": "9:16",
    "saveToLibrary": true
  }'</code></pre>
<p>The response includes a <code>jobId</code> that you can poll via <code>GET /v1/render-jobs/{jobId}</code> to track progress (queued → processing → completed).</p>
<h3>3. Manage Content Items</h3>
<p>Once a video is ready, it appears in your library. You can list items with:</p>
<pre><code>curl "https://api.content3.app/v1/content-items?type=video&limit=20" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $C3_KEY"</code></pre>
<p>The response provides IDs, titles, thumbnails, and URLs for each asset, enabling you to build custom galleries or feed them into downstream workflows.</p>
<h3>4. Human‑In‑The‑Loop Review</h3>
<p>Before publishing, many teams require a manual review. The skill lets you create a review object, attach the video, and add metadata such as tags and notes:</p>
<pre><code>curl -X POST "https://api.content3.app/v1/reviews" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $C3_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Weekly Cat Facts Batch",
    "description": "5 short‑form videos for review",
    "contentType": "video",
    "attachments": [{"url": "https://r2.example.com/video1.mp4", "label": "Cat facts"}],
    "metadata": {"tags": ["short‑form","cat"], "notes": "Generated from trending Reddit posts"}
  }'</code></pre>
<p>Review status can be moved through a defined state machine (pending → in_review → approved/rejected). If reviewers request changes, you can submit a new revision with updated attachments.</p>
<h3>5. Promote Approved Content to the Library</h3>
<p>When a review reaches <code>approved</code>, promote it to a content item that can be used for social drafts:</p>
<pre><code>curl -X POST "https://api.content3.app/v1/reviews/{review_id}/promote" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $C3_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Cat Physics Explained","description":"Why cats always land on their feet"}'</code></pre>
<p>The response returns the new <code>contentItem</code> ID, ready for the next step.</p>
<h3>6. Generate AI‑Powered Social Media Drafts</h3>
<p>With a content item ID in hand, you can ask the platform to generate platform‑specific copy:</p>
<pre><code>curl -X POST "https://api.content3.app/v1/social/generate-content" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $C3_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "contentItemId": "content-item-uuid",
    "platforms": ["tiktok","youtube"],
    "userPrompt": "Make it engaging, add trending hashtags"
  }'</code></pre>
<p>The AI returns captions, hashtags, and suggested titles. You then create a draft (either the detailed <em>format A</em> or the shorthand <em>format B</em>) and finally publish it with a single call to <code>POST /v1/social/drafts/{draft_id}/publish</code>.</p>
<h2>Real‑World Use Cases</h2>
<p>Below are three concrete scenarios where the Content3 skill shines.</p>
<h3>1. Digital Marketing Agencies</h3>
<p>Agencies often need to produce dozens of short videos for client campaigns. By automating script generation from Reddit trends, selecting a brand‑aligned voice, and pushing the final video through a review workflow, teams can cut production time from days to hours. The AI‑generated captions and hashtags further boost organic reach on TikTok and Instagram.</p>
<h3>2. E‑Learning Platforms</h3>
<p>Educators can feed lecture outlines or textbook excerpts into the <code>text</code> source type, instantly receiving a narrated video with a chosen voice (e.g., “Kore” for a calm tone). After a quick peer review, the video is added to the course library and shared on YouTube Shorts, expanding the learning audience.</p>
<h3>3. Solo Content Creators &#038; Influencers</h3>
<p>Individual creators can use the skill to repurpose blog posts into bite‑size videos, then auto‑generate platform‑specific captions. The built‑in review step ensures quality control without hiring an editor, while the publishing endpoint handles multi‑platform distribution in one click.</p>
<h2>Key Benefits of Using the Content3 Skill</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Speed &amp; Scale</strong>: Generate up to 100 videos per day via the API, dramatically outpacing manual production.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency</strong>: Voice selection and aspect‑ratio presets guarantee a uniform brand look across all assets.</li>
<li><strong>Human Oversight</strong>: The review workflow adds a safety net for compliance, brand guidelines, or factual accuracy.</li>
<li><strong>AI‑Enhanced Social Copy</strong>: Captions, hashtags, and platform‑specific tweaks are created automatically, reducing copy‑writing workload.</li>
<li><strong>Full Integration</strong>: All actions are exposed via REST endpoints, making it easy to embed the skill in CI/CD pipelines, content calendars, or custom dashboards.</li>
<li><strong>Cost‑Effective</strong>: By reusing the same API key across projects, teams avoid licensing multiple video‑editing tools.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Practices for Maximizing ROI</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Define Clear Voice &amp; Aspect Ratio Guidelines</strong> – Choose a voice that matches your brand personality and stick to one or two aspect ratios (e.g., 9:16 for TikTok, 16:9 for YouTube) to simplify downstream publishing.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage the Review API Early</strong> – Set up automated notifications (Slack, email) when a review enters <code>in_review</code> so reviewers can act quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Tag Content Rigorously</strong> – Use the <code>metadata.tags</code> field to categorize videos by topic, campaign, or audience segment. This makes bulk operations (e.g., “publish all #summer‑campaign videos”) trivial.</li>
<li><strong>Cache Generated Drafts</strong> – Store the AI‑generated captions in your CMS; if you need to tweak a hashtag later, you won’t have to re‑run the generation step.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor Job Status</strong> – Poll <code>/render-jobs/{jobId}</code> with exponential back‑off to avoid hitting rate limits while still receiving timely updates.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Content3 skill is more than a collection of API calls; it is a complete, end‑to‑end solution for modern content teams. By automating short‑form video creation, providing a robust review loop, and delivering AI‑driven social media drafts, it empowers marketers, educators, and creators to produce high‑quality, platform‑ready content at unprecedented speed. Implement the skill today, and watch your content pipeline transform from a bottleneck into a competitive advantage.</p>
