<h1>Agent Guardrails: Mechanical Enforcement for AI Project Standards</h1>
<p>The Agent Guardrails skill by OpenClaw is a powerful tool designed to prevent AI agents from bypassing rules set by developers. Developed by jzOcb, this skill provides 100% reliable-code enforcement through several means, including git hooks, secret detection, deployment verification, and import registries.</p>
<p>Unlike typical markdown rules which are more suggestive, Agent Guardrails enforces code standards mechanically. It was developed in response to production incidents such as server crashes, token leaks, and code rewrites.</p>
<h2>Why Agent Guardrails?</h2>
<p>While AI agents are becoming increasingly advanced, they have a tendency to find ways of bypassing rules and standards set by developers. This can result in production incidents, compromised security, and other issues that ultimately affect the user experience.</p>
<p>Agent Guardrails is designed to prevent these scenarios by mechanically enforcing rules through code hooks.</p>
<h2>Installation and Usage</h2>
<p>To use Agent Guardrails, simply navigate to your project&#8217;s directory and execute the following command:</p>
<pre>cd your-project/ &amp;&amp; bash /path/to/agent-guardrails/scripts/install.sh</pre>
<p>This installs the git pre-commit hook, creates a registry template, and copies check scripts into your project. This only needs to be executed once per project.</p>
<h2>Agent Guardrails Enforcement Hierarchy</h2>
<p>Agent Guardrails provides a spectrum of enforcement reliability. Here&#8217;s a breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code Hooks (git pre-commit, pre/post-creation checks) &#8211; 100% reliable</li>
<li>Architectural Constraints (registries, import enforcement) &#8211; 95% reliable</li>
<li>Self-verification Loops (agent checks own work) &#8211; 80% reliable</li>
<li>Prompt Rules (AGENTS.md, system prompts) &#8211; 60-70% reliable</li>
<li>Markdown Rules &#8211; 40-50% reliable, degrades with context length</li>
</ul>

<h2>Workflow</h2>
<p>Setting up a new project is a breeze. Simply run the following command:</p>
<pre>bash scripts/install.sh /path/to/project</pre>
<p>Before you create a new Python file, run the pre-create check script to review existing modules/functions that might already cover your needs.</p>
<pre>bash scripts/pre-create-check.sh /path/to/project</pre>
<p>After creating or editing a Python file, use the post-create check script to bring up any warnings that need addressing before proceeding to the next step.</p>
<pre>bash scripts/post-create-validate.sh /path/to/new_file.py</pre>
<p>Setting up deployment verification is just as simple. Run the following command:</p>
<pre>bash scripts/create-deployment-check.sh /path/to/project</pre>
<p>This command accomplishes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creates a .deployment-check.sh &#8211; an automated verification script</li>
<li>Produces a DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md file with a complete deployment workflow</li>
<li>Creates a git hook template</li>
</ul>
<p>From here, simply customize your tests in .deployment-check.sh to meet your integration standards, document your deployment workflow in DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md and install the git hook. You can find a comprehensive guide on deployment verification in references/deployment-verification-guide.md.</p>
<p>Agent Guardrails also provides a quick-start template that you can use to create an AGENTS.md file that is tailored to your project. Simply copy the template from references/agents-md-template.md and adapt it to your project.</p>
<h2>Common Agent Failure Modes</h2>
<p>When working with AI agents, there are a few failure modes that you may encounter. Here&#8217;s a breakdown of the most common issues and how Agent Guardrails provides enforcement.</p>
