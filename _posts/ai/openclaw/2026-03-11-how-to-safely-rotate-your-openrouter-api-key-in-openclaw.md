<h2>What This Skill Does</h2>
<p>The <code>rotate-openrouter-key</code> skill in OpenClaw provides a comprehensive solution for safely replacing your OpenRouter API key across your entire OpenClaw installation. This skill is essential when you need to update your API credentials due to security concerns, key expiration, or when your current key has been compromised.</p>
<h2>When to Use This Skill</h2>
<p>This skill should be used in several scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a user requests to &#8220;rotate my openrouter key&#8221; or &#8220;change openrouter key&#8221;</li>
<li>When experiencing 401 authentication errors from OpenRouter</li>
<li>When an old key has been disabled and needs replacement</li>
<li>For periodic security key rotation</li>
</ul>
<h2>Understanding OpenClaw&#8217;s Key Priority Chain</h2>
<p>OpenClaw reads the OpenRouter API key from three different sources, with each level taking precedence over the ones below it:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Highest Priority:</strong> <code>~/.openclaw/.env</code> &#8211; Environment file that overrides all other configurations</li>
<li><strong>Medium Priority:</strong> <code>~/.openclaw/agents//agent/models.json</code> &#8211; Per-agent configuration files</li>
<li><strong>Lowest Priority:</strong> <code>~/.openclaw/openclaw.json</code> &#8211; Global configuration file</li>
</ol>
<p>Understanding this hierarchy is crucial because if a higher-priority source contains the old key, updating lower-priority files won&#8217;t resolve the issue. You must update the key at whatever level it&#8217;s actually being read from.</p>
<h2>Step-by-Step Workflow</h2>
<h3>Step 1: Obtain the New Key</h3>
<p>Begin by asking the user for their new OpenRouter API key. The key must start with <code>sk-or-v1-</code>. If they don&#8217;t have a new key yet, direct them to <a href="https://openrouter.ai/keys" target="_blank">openrouter.ai/keys</a> to generate one.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Locate All Key Storage Locations</h3>
<p>Before making any changes, identify every location where the OpenRouter key might be stored. Use these commands to find all relevant files:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># Find all files containing OpenRouter keys
find ~/.openclaw/ -name "*.json" -o -name ".env" | xargs grep -l "sk-or-v1" 2>/dev/null

# Check for uncommented keys in .env file
grep -v '^#' ~/.openclaw/.env 2>/dev/null | grep OPENROUTER_API_KEY
</code></pre>
<p>Report these findings to the user before proceeding with any updates.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Update All Locations and Verify</h3>
<p>The skill uses a helper script that handles both <code>.env</code> and JSON files in a single operation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">python3 scripts/update-openrouter-key.py --key "sk-or-v1-NEW-KEY" --verify
</code></pre>
<p>This script performs several important functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finds all configuration files containing OpenRouter keys</li>
<li>Creates timestamped backups before making any changes</li>
<li>Updates only the key value while preserving the rest of the configuration</li>
<li>Verifies the new key against the OpenRouter API</li>
<li>Provides a detailed report of what was changed</li>
</ul>
<p>For safety, you can preview changes first using the <code>--dry-run</code> option:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">python3 scripts/update-openrouter-key.py --key "sk-or-v1-NEW-KEY" --dry-run
</code></pre>
<h3>Step 4: Restart the Gateway</h3>
<p>After updating all configuration files, restart the OpenClaw gateway to ensure the new key takes effect:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">openclaw gateway restart
</code></pre>
<h3>Step 5: Handle Remote Hosts</h3>
<p>If you manage OpenClaw installations on multiple machines, you&#8217;ll need to repeat the process on each remote host. Use SSH to connect and perform the same steps:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">ssh user@host "find ~/.openclaw/ -name '*.json' -o -name '.env' | xargs grep -l 'sk-or-v1'"
</code></pre>
<p>Then either run the update script remotely or copy it to the remote host and execute it there.</p>
<h3>Step 6: Disable the Old Key</h3>
<p>Only after verifying that the new key works correctly everywhere should you disable or delete the old key from <a href="https://openrouter.ai/keys" target="_blank">openrouter.ai/keys</a>. This ensures you have a working backup if something goes wrong during the transition.</p>
<h2>Common Issues and Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3>401 Authentication Errors After Update</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re still receiving 401 errors after updating the key, you likely missed a configuration location. Re-run the search command from Step 2 to find any remaining files with the old key.</p>
<h3>Key Works in API Calls but Not in Bot</h3>
<p>This typically indicates that the <code>.env</code> file still contains the old key, which takes precedence over JSON configurations. Check and update the <code>.env</code> file specifically.</p>
<h3>Gateway Won&#8217;t Restart</h3>
<p>If the gateway fails to restart after the key update, this might be unrelated to the key change. Try stopping and starting the gateway explicitly:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">openclaw gateway stop
openclaw gateway start
</code></pre>
<h3>Remote Host Still Failing</h3>
<p>If a remote host continues to have issues, you may have forgotten to update its configurations. SSH into the remote host and repeat Steps 2-5.</p>
<h2>Scope and Limitations</h2>
<p>This skill specifically handles OpenRouter API key rotation and has the following boundaries:</p>
<h3>What It Handles</h3>
<ul>
<li>Finding all locations where OpenRouter keys are stored</li>
<li>Updating keys across all configuration files</li>
<li>Verifying the new key works with OpenRouter&#8217;s API</li>
<li>Creating backups before making changes</li>
</ul>
<h3>What It Doesn&#8217;t Handle</h3>
<ul>
<li>Generating or revoking keys (must be done on openrouter.ai)</li>
<li>Managing keys for other providers like Anthropic or OpenAI</li>
<li>Billing or usage-related issues</li>
<li>Keys stored outside the <code>~/.openclaw/</code> directory (such as in systemd environment files)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Practices for Key Management</h2>
<p>Regular key rotation is a crucial security practice. Consider implementing these guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rotate keys every 90 days as a security best practice</li>
<li>Always verify the new key works before disabling the old one</li>
<li>Keep a record of when keys were rotated and by whom</li>
<li>Test the rotation process in a non-production environment first</li>
<li>Ensure you have access to the OpenRouter dashboard to manage keys</li>
</ul>
<h2>Security Considerations</h2>
<p>When rotating API keys, keep these security principles in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Never share API keys in logs, error messages, or public repositories</li>
<li>Use environment variables for sensitive configuration when possible</li>
<li>Limit API key permissions to only what&#8217;s necessary</li>
<li>Monitor API usage for unusual patterns that might indicate compromise</li>
<li>Have a rollback plan in case the new key doesn&#8217;t work as expected</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The <code>rotate-openrouter-key</code> skill provides a systematic approach to updating your OpenRouter API credentials across your entire OpenClaw installation. By following the outlined workflow and understanding the key priority chain, you can ensure a smooth transition with minimal downtime. Remember to always verify the new key works before disabling the old one, and consider implementing regular key rotation as part of your security practices.</p>
