<p>The OpenClaw compress-pdf skill is a specialized tool designed to efficiently compress PDF files through the Cross-Service-Solutions platform. This skill automates the entire process of PDF compression, from file upload to final download, making it an invaluable resource for users who need to reduce PDF file sizes without compromising quality.</p>
<p><strong>How the Skill Works</strong></p>
<p>The compress-pdf skill operates through a straightforward workflow. When a user provides a PDF file, the skill automatically uploads it to the Cross-Service-Solutions compression API. The system then monitors the compression job&#8217;s progress, polling the API until the processing is complete. Once finished, the skill returns a direct download URL for the compressed file, allowing users to access their optimized PDF immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Authentication and Security</strong></p>
<p>To use this skill, users must provide an API key for authentication. The skill requires the API key to be included as a Bearer token in the Authorization header. Security is a top priority, and the skill includes a strict rule never to echo or log the API key, ensuring user credentials remain protected throughout the process.</p>
<p><strong>API Endpoints and Configuration</strong></p>
<p>The skill interacts with the Cross-Service-Solutions API through specific endpoints. The base URL is https://api.xss-cross-service-solutions.com/solutions/solutions. To create a compression job, the skill sends a POST request to /api/29 with the PDF file and optional parameters including imageQuality (ranging from 0 to 100, default 75) and dpi (ranging from 72 to 300, default 144). Users can check the job status by sending a GET request to /api/<ID>, where the response includes the output files with downloadable URLs.</p>
<p><strong>Input Requirements and Options</strong></p>
<p>The skill requires two essential inputs: the PDF file in binary format and the API key as a string. Users can also specify optional parameters to customize the compression process. The imageQuality parameter allows adjustment of the compression level, with higher values maintaining better image quality but resulting in larger file sizes. The dpi parameter controls the resolution of any images within the PDF, affecting both quality and file size.</p>
<p><strong>Output and Results</strong></p>
<p>Upon completion, the skill provides a structured result containing the job ID, status, download URL, file name, and the settings used for compression. This comprehensive output allows users to verify the compression parameters and easily access their compressed PDF. The skill&#8217;s ability to handle the entire compression process automatically makes it particularly useful for users who need to process multiple PDFs or integrate PDF compression into larger workflows.</p>
<p><strong>Practical Applications</strong></p>
<p>This skill is especially valuable for professionals who frequently work with PDFs, such as lawyers, educators, and business professionals. It can help reduce email attachment sizes, improve website loading times for PDF documents, and optimize storage space. The skill&#8217;s automation capabilities make it ideal for batch processing or integration with other document management systems.</p>
<p><strong>Getting Started</strong></p>
<p>Users can obtain an API key by registering at https://login.cross-service-solutions.com/register. Once registered, they can use the compress-pdf skill by providing their PDF file and API key. The skill&#8217;s straightforward interface and automated processing make it accessible even to users with limited technical expertise.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits and Advantages</strong></p>
<p>The compress-pdf skill offers several key advantages. It eliminates the need for manual file uploads and downloads, saving time and reducing the potential for errors. The skill&#8217;s ability to handle the entire compression process automatically means users can focus on other tasks while their PDFs are being processed. Additionally, the skill&#8217;s integration with Cross-Service-Solutions ensures high-quality compression results using professional-grade algorithms.</p>
<p>By providing a seamless, automated solution for PDF compression, the OpenClaw compress-pdf skill represents a significant advancement in document processing technology.
