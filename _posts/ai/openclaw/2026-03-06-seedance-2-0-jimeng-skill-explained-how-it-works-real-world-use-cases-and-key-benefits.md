<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>ByteDance’s <strong>Seedance 2.0</strong> is a next‑generation multimodal generative model that can turn text, images, video clips, and audio into short, high‑quality video segments (4‑15 seconds).  While the model itself is powerful, getting the most out of it requires a disciplined prompting approach.  The <strong>JiMeng Skill</strong>—hosted on the OpenClaw/ClawHub ecosystem—provides exactly that discipline.  It is a ready‑to‑use <em>prompt‑engineering</em> skill that guides creators from a vague idea to a production‑ready prompt, handling asset mapping, timeline beats, negative constraints, and platform limits automatically.</p>
<h2>Why a Dedicated Skill?</h2>
<p>Seedance 2.0’s flexibility is a double‑edged sword.  The model accepts up to 12 mixed assets (images, video, audio) and can generate a wide variety of visual styles, but without a structured workflow the output can be inconsistent, overly generic, or even rejected by the platform’s moderation system.  The JiMeng Skill solves these problems by codifying best‑practice rules, providing a clear output template, and embedding IP‑safe strategies directly into the prompt‑creation process.</p>
<h1>What the JiMeng Skill Does</h1>
<p>At its core, the skill is a <strong>prompt‑generation assistant</strong> that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collects user requirements (desired mode, reference assets, story beats, tone).</li>
<li>Creates an <em>Assets Mapping</em> section that tells Seedance exactly which file controls identity, camera language, sound, or motion.</li>
<li>Generates a time‑coded <em>Final Prompt</em> that breaks a 4‑15 s video into logical segments (e.g., 0‑3 s: establishing shot, 3‑7 s: action, 7‑10 s: climax).</li>
<li>Appends <em>Negative Constraints</em> to keep the model from adding watermarks, logos, subtitles, or any brand‑specific elements that could trigger moderation.</li>
<li>Provides a ready‑to‑paste <em>Generation Settings</em> block (duration, aspect ratio, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>The result is a clean, copy‑and‑paste prompt that respects Seedance’s technical limits and moderation policies while giving the creator fine‑grained control over visual storytelling.</p>
<h2>Supported Modes</h2>
<p>The skill supports three primary modes, each suited to a different workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Text‑Only</strong>: No reference assets are supplied.  The prompt must describe style, color palette, camera moves, and timeline beats entirely in text.  Ideal for original concepts or when IP‑safe content is required.</li>
<li><strong>First/Last Frame</strong>: One image anchors the identity (first frame) or the final composition (last frame).  The model interpolates motion between the anchor and the generated content.</li>
<li><strong>All‑Reference</strong>: Multiple assets (images, video clips, audio) are mapped to specific functions (e.g., @image1 for character design, @video1 for camera language).  This mode yields the highest fidelity to the creator’s vision.</li>
</ul>
<h1>How the Skill Works – Step‑by‑Step</h1>
<ol>
<li><strong>Mode Declaration</strong>: The skill forces the user to start with <code>Mode: …</code>.  This tells Seedance how to interpret the following assets.</li>
<li><strong>Asset Upload &#038; Mapping</strong>: Users upload up to 12 files (max 9 images, 3 videos, 3 audio).  The skill automatically generates an <code>Assets Mapping</code> block, e.g.
<pre>Assets Mapping:
- @image1: first frame / identity anchor
- @video1: camera language + motion rhythm
- @audio1: soundtrack pacing</pre>
</li>
<li><strong>Timeline Planning</strong>: The creator defines beats in seconds (0‑3 s, 3‑7 s, etc.).  The skill enforces a single major action per segment to keep the prompt concise and controllable.</li>
<li><strong>Prompt Construction</strong>: Using the mode, asset mapping, and beats, the skill assembles a <code>Final Prompt</code> block that includes style tags, aspect ratio, and duration.
<pre>Final Prompt:
[9:16], 10s, neon‑cyberpunk style.
0‑3s: establishing wide shot of rain‑slick alley, camera dolly forward.
3‑7s: heroine in red trench coat runs, low‑angle tracking.
7‑10s: close‑up on face, neon glare, fade to black.</pre>
</li>
<li><strong>Negative Constraints</strong>: The skill adds a list of things the model must avoid (watermark, logo, on‑screen text, any recognizable franchise names).
<pre>Negative Constraints:
no watermark, no logo, no subtitles, no brand names, no copyrighted characters.</pre>
</li>
<li><strong>Generation Settings</strong>: Finally, the skill outputs a <code>Generation Settings</code> block (duration, aspect ratio, seed, etc.) ready for direct copy‑paste into Seedance’s UI or API.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Built‑In Moderation‑Safe Strategies</h2>
<p>Seedance 2.0 enforces strict content moderation.  The JiMeng Skill embeds three safety layers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>IP‑Safe Naming</strong>: All characters and objects are given original names (e.g., &#8220;Alloy Sentinel&#8221; instead of a known superhero).</li>
<li><strong>Feature Substitution</strong>: Recognizable visual cues (arc reactor, iconic helmets) are replaced with generic equivalents (hex‑light core, matte alloy visor).</li>
<li><strong>Progressive Fallback</strong>: If a prompt is rejected, the skill can automatically rewrite it at three escalation levels—nicknames, visual redesign, or complete character type change—until it passes moderation.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Real‑World Use Cases</h1>
<p>Because the skill is mode‑agnostic, it fits a wide range of production scenarios.  Below are the most common applications, each with a brief example of how the skill would be used.</p>
<h2>1. E‑Commerce &#038; Product Showcases</h2>
<p>Brands need short, eye‑catching videos that highlight product features.  Using <strong>All‑Reference</strong> mode, a marketer uploads a high‑resolution product photo (@image1) and a short 2‑second turntable video (@video1).  The skill creates a prompt that instructs Seedance to spin the product 360°, add a glossy reflection, and overlay a subtle sound effect.  Negative constraints ensure no competitor logos appear.</p>
<h2>2. Short Drama &#038; Dialogue‑Driven Scenes</h2>
<p>Writers can script a 10‑second micro‑drama.  The skill separates visual action from dialogue:</p>
<pre>Dialogue (Lena, anxious): "We don’t have much time!"
Sound: rapid heartbeat thump.</pre>
<p>  The timeline might be 0‑3 s: establishing shot, 3‑6 s: character runs, 6‑10 s: close‑up with dialogue.  This structure keeps the generated video coherent and ensures lip‑sync timing.</p>
<h2>3. Fantasy / Xianxia Animation</h2>
<p>For high‑fantasy concepts, creators upload concept art for a sword (@image1) and a reference clip of a martial‑arts kata (@video1).  The skill maps the sword to identity, the kata to camera rhythm, and adds spell‑FX descriptors (&#8220;emerald particle trail&#8221;, &#8220;energy aura&#8221;).  The result is a short spell‑casting sequence that respects the original choreography.</p>
<h2>4. Science &#038; Education Visuals</h2>
<p>Educators can generate 4‑second explainer clips.  Using <strong>Text‑Only</strong> mode, the skill prompts Seedance to render a 3D model of a cell, zoom into the nucleus, and label organelles with on‑screen text—while the <em>Negative Constraints</em> block disables any unrelated branding.</p>
<h2>5. Music Video &#038; Beat‑Sync</h2>
<p>Musicians upload a 15‑second audio loop (@audio1) and a series of mood images (@image1‑@image3).  The skill creates a beat‑locked prompt where each 4‑second segment matches a visual change to the audio’s rhythm, producing a dynamic mini‑music video.</p>
<h2>6. Toy / Figure Animation</h2>
<p>When animating a collectible figure, the skill strips all brand identifiers, maps the figure’s silhouette to @image1, and instructs Seedance to animate a simple spin and a light‑bounce effect.  The final video looks like an original art piece, avoiding trademark infringement.</p>
<h2>7. Long‑Form Storytelling (Multi‑Segment Stitching)</h2>
<p>For narratives longer than 15 seconds, the skill guides creators to split the story into 15‑second segments, each ending on a clean handoff frame.  It automatically generates continuity notes (e.g., &#8220;last frame shows hero holding sword, camera low‑angle&#8221;) and the <code>Extend @video1 by Xs</code> command for the next segment.</p>
<h1>Key Benefits</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Precision Control</strong>: Time‑coded beats and explicit asset mapping give creators deterministic control over motion, lighting, and composition.</li>
<li><strong>Speed &#038; Efficiency</strong>: The skill automates the tedious parts of prompt writing, reducing the time from concept to generation from hours to minutes.</li>
<li><strong>Moderation‑Safe Output</strong>: Built‑in IP‑avoidance rules and negative constraints dramatically lower the chance of prompt rejection.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Whether you need a single 5‑second ad or a 60‑second story broken into four segments, the skill scales without extra manual effort.</li>
<li><strong>Cross‑Domain Flexibility</strong>: From product ads to fantasy battles, the same skill works across industries, making it a universal prompt‑engineering layer for Seedance 2.0.</li>
<li><strong>Creative Collaboration</strong>: Teams can share the generated prompt skeletons, edit them collaboratively, and maintain a single source of truth for video production pipelines.</li>
</ul>
<h2>SEO Advantages for Content Creators</h2>
<p>Because the skill forces creators to include descriptive keywords (style, camera language, visual motifs) directly in the prompt, the resulting videos are more likely to be indexed correctly on platforms that support AI‑generated content metadata.  Adding explicit tags such as &#8220;neon‑cyberpunk&#8221;, &#8220;low‑angle tracking&#8221;, or &#8220;product showcase&#8221; improves discoverability and aligns with SEO best practices for short‑form video platforms (TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts).</p>
