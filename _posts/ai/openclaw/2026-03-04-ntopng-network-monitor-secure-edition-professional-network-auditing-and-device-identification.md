<h2>What is ntopng Network Monitor (Secure Edition)?</h2>
<p>ntopng-admin is a professional network monitoring and device identification tool that leverages ntopng Redis data through a secure SSH tunnel. This specialized skill is designed for network administrators and security professionals who require comprehensive visibility into local network traffic for security auditing and diagnostic purposes.</p>
<p>The tool performs high-privilege operations including executing commands on network gateways via SSH and reading internal network states. It provides granular traffic analysis, device classification, and connection auditing capabilities that make it invaluable for security teams and network administrators.</p>
<h3>Core Functionality</h3>
<p>At its core, ntopng-admin queries network data directly from ntopng&#8217;s Redis database through an encrypted SSH tunnel. This approach ensures data integrity while maintaining security during transmission. The tool can identify devices by MAC and IP addresses, analyze traffic patterns, detect protocol anomalies, and provide detailed forensic information about network activity.</p>
<h2>How ntopng-admin Works</h2>
<p>The tool operates through a sophisticated architecture that combines SSH tunneling with Redis data extraction. Here&#8217;s a breakdown of its operational workflow:</p>
<h3>1. SSH Tunnel Establishment</h3>
<p>ntopng-admin creates a secure SSH tunnel between the monitoring host and the target ntopng server. This tunnel uses public key authentication, eliminating the need for password-based access and significantly reducing the attack surface. The SSH connection typically uses port 50222 for OPNsense environments, though this can be configured.</p>
<h3>2. Redis Data Extraction</h3>
<p>Once the tunnel is established, the tool queries ntopng&#8217;s Redis database for network information. This includes device metadata, traffic statistics, connection logs, and protocol information. The data is extracted using JSON processing tools like jq, ensuring structured and reliable data retrieval.</p>
<h3>3. Data Processing and Analysis</h3>
<p>The extracted data undergoes processing to provide meaningful insights. This includes traffic volume calculations, device classification based on behavior patterns, protocol identification, and anomaly detection. The tool can identify devices using various heuristics including MAC address patterns, traffic characteristics, and connection behaviors.</p>
<h3>4. Command Execution Framework</h3>
<p>ntopng-admin provides a command-line interface with multiple operational modes. Users can execute commands to list devices, retrieve detailed information about specific hosts, audit connections, and monitor network health. Each command is designed to be read-only and non-intrusive, preserving network stability.</p>
<h2>Key Features and Capabilities</h2>
<h3>Network Inventory Management</h3>
<p>The tool can generate comprehensive network inventories, listing all detected devices with their MAC addresses, IP addresses, traffic volumes, and last-seen timestamps. This feature is essential for asset management and network documentation.</p>
<h3>Device Forensics</h3>
<p>For detailed investigation, ntopng-admin provides device-specific forensic capabilities. Users can retrieve granular traffic breakdowns, packet counts, and inferred device classifications. This helps in identifying unknown devices, troubleshooting connectivity issues, and investigating suspicious activity.</p>
<h3>Connection Audit</h3>
<p>The connection audit feature allows security teams to examine external connections made by internal devices. This includes extracting samples of domains contacted, analyzing connection patterns, and identifying potential data exfiltration or unauthorized communications.</p>
<h3>Health and Statistics Monitoring</h3>
<p>ntopng-admin includes monitoring capabilities to verify ntopng service status and provide global network statistics. This helps in maintaining system health and understanding overall network behavior patterns.</p>
<h2>Prerequisites and Setup</h2>
<p>Before deploying ntopng-admin, several prerequisites must be met:</p>
<h3>SSH Key Authentication</h3>
<p>Public key authentication must be configured between the monitoring host and the ntopng server. This eliminates password vulnerabilities and enables automated access. SSH keys should be protected with strong passphrases where possible.</p>
<h3>Binary Dependencies</h3>
<p>The tool requires specific binaries to be available on the monitoring system: ssh for secure connections and jq for JSON processing. These tools must be properly installed and accessible in the system PATH.</p>
<h3>Backend Requirements</h3>
<p>ntopng must be running with Redis persistence enabled on the target host. This ensures that historical data is available for analysis and that the tool can retrieve comprehensive network information.</p>
<h2>Configuration Parameters</h2>
<p>ntopng-admin uses several environment variables for configuration:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OPNSENSE_HOST</strong>: Target gateway IP or hostname (default: 192.168.1.1)</li>
<li><strong>OPNSENSE_SSH_PORT</strong>: SSH service port (default: 50222)</li>
<li><strong>NTOP_INSECURE</strong>: SSL verification setting for self-signed certificates</li>
</ul>
<p>These parameters can be set in the environment or through configuration files, providing flexibility for different deployment scenarios.</p>
<h2>Available Commands</h2>
<p>The tool provides several commands through its helper script:</p>
<h3>Network Inventory</h3>
<pre><code>./scripts/ntopng-helper.sh list [limit]
</code></pre>
<p>This command lists detected devices with comprehensive details including MAC addresses, IP addresses, traffic volumes, and last-seen timestamps. The optional limit parameter controls the number of results returned.</p>
<h3>Device Information</h3>
<pre><code>./scripts/ntopng-helper.sh device-info &lt;ip|mac&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This command provides detailed information about a specific device, including traffic breakdown, packet counts, and classification information. It&#8217;s useful for investigating individual hosts and understanding their network behavior.</p>
<h3>Connection Audit</h3>
<pre><code>./scripts/ntopng-helper.sh connections &lt;ip&gt; [sample_size]
</code></pre>
<p>This feature extracts samples of external connections made by a specific device, helping identify data exfiltration, unauthorized communications, or compliance violations.</p>
<h3>System Health</h3>
<pre><code>./scripts/ntopng-helper.sh status   # Verifies ntopng service state
./scripts/ntopng-helper.sh stats    # Global device counts
</code></pre>
<p>These commands help maintain system health by verifying service status and providing network-wide statistics.</p>
<h2>Security Implementation</h2>
<p>ntopng-admin incorporates several security measures to protect sensitive network data:</p>
<h3>No Secret Leaking</h3>
<p>The scripts are hardened to never echo credentials or sensitive environment variables. This prevents accidental exposure of authentication information or network configuration details.</p>
<h3>Input Sanitization</h3>
<p>All arguments are filtered to prevent shell injection attempts. This protects against malicious input that could compromise the monitoring system or the target network.</p>
<h3>Secure by Default</h3>
<p>SSL verification is enabled by default, requiring explicit configuration changes for lab environments. This ensures that production deployments maintain strong security postures.</p>
<h2>Data Interpretation Guide</h2>
<p>Understanding the data provided by ntopng-admin is crucial for effective network security:</p>
<h3>Exfiltration Pattern Detection</h3>
<p>An upload-to-download ratio higher than 5:1 on non-server devices indicates potential data exfiltration. This pattern suggests unauthorized data transmission and should trigger immediate investigation.</p>
<h3>Device Spoofing Identification</h3>
<p>Unexpected MAC addresses or addresses with DE:AD:BE:EF prefixes (common in VPN/tunnel interfaces) should be verified. These patterns can indicate device spoofing or unauthorized network access.</p>
<h3>Protocol Anomalies</h3>
<p>Devices using unexpected protocols or services should be investigated. The tool&#8217;s app command can detect violations of local security policies, such as unauthorized SSH servers or HTTP services on restricted devices.</p>
<h2>Use Cases and Applications</h2>
<p>ntopng-admin serves multiple critical functions in network security and administration:</p>
