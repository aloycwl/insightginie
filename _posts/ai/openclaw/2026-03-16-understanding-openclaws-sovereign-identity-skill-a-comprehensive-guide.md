<p>In today&#8217;s digital landscape, managing identities securely and efficiently is crucial, especially for businesses and individuals interacting online. The Sovereign Identity Skill from <a href="https://github.com/openclaw/skills/tree/main/skills/tamtunnel/sovereign-id">OpenClaw</a> is a powerful tool designed to address these needs. This skill enables agents to manage their own decentralized identities (DIDs) and generate cryptographic proofs, ensuring trust and security in business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) interactions.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we will delve into the details of this skill, its purpose, guidelines, decision matrix, security guardrails, and handshake protocol.</p>
<h2>Purpose of the Sovereign Identity Skill</h2>
<p>The primary goal of the Sovereign Identity Skill is to provide a robust framework for agents to manage their identities and generate cryptographic proofs. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DID Management:</strong> Enabling agents to create and manage decentralized identifiers (DIDs), ensuring control and ownership of their digital identities.</li>
<li><strong>Cryptographic Proofs:</strong> Generating proofs that can be used to verify identity and credentials without exposing sensitive personal information.</li>
<li><strong>B2B and B2C Trust:</strong> Facilitating secure interactions between businesses and consumers by providing a trusted and verifiable method of identity management.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Guidelines for Using the Sovereign Identity Skill</h2>
<p>The Sovereign Identity Skill operates under strict guidelines to ensure security and privacy:</p>
<h3>Never</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reveal the Owner&#8217;s Real Name or Private Keys:</strong> Protecting the owner&#8217;s identity and security is paramount. Private keys should never be exposed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Always</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Generate a Pairwise DID for Every New B2C Interaction:</strong> This ensures that each interaction is unique and prevents tracking across different services.</li>
</ul>
<h2>B2B Requirements (Financial/Legal)</h2>
<p>When interacting with another business agent, the Sovereign Identity Skill enforces the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attach a Signed Mandate from the Owner:</strong> A signed mandate is a cryptographic proof that authorizes the agent to perform specific tasks on behalf of the owner. This is crucial for ensuring that financial and legal interactions are conducted securely and with proper authorization.</li>
</ul>
<h2>B2C Requirements (Access/Browsing)</h2>
<p>For interactions with consumers, such as accessing services or browsing, the Sovereign Identity Skill uses Selective Disclosure (SD-JWT) to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prove Age, Residency, or Accreditation:</strong> Without sharing the underlying document. This ensures that only the necessary information is disclosed, enhancing privacy and security.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decision Matrix (The Brain)</h2>
<p>The Sovereign Identity Skill employs a decision matrix to determine which identity persona to use in different contexts. This matrix ensures that the appropriate identity and protocol are selected based on the nature of the interaction:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Context</th>
<th>Trigger Keywords</th>
<th>Identity Persona</th>
<th>Protocol</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Financial</td>
<td>&#8220;invoice&#8221;, &#8220;payment&#8221;, &#8220;contract&#8221;, &#8220;sign&#8221;, &#8220;buy&#8221;</td>
<td>Work (Corporate DID)</td>
<td>Signed Mandate (JWS)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Public/Browsing</td>
<td>&#8220;register&#8221;, &#8220;signup&#8221;, &#8220;access&#8221;, &#8220;view&#8221;, &#8220;qualify&#8221;</td>
<td>Ghost (Pairwise DID)</td>
<td>SD-JWT (Selective Disclosure)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Personal</td>
<td>&#8220;my account&#8221;, &#8220;personal email&#8221;, &#8220;home&#8221;</td>
<td>Personal DID</td>
<td>ZKP / SD-JWT</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h2>Tools Provided by the Sovereign Identity Skill</h2>
<p>The skill offers a set of tools to facilitate secure identity management and proof generation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>generate_did()</strong>: Creates a new decentralized identifier (DID).</li>
<li><strong>sign_mandate(task_description, limit)</strong>: Signs an authorization for a specific task, with a defined limit on the authorization.</li>
<li><strong>present_sd_jwt(claims_to_reveal)</strong>: Generates a Selective Disclosure JWT, which hides all other claims except those specified.</li>
<li><strong>identity_check(context, keywords)</strong>: Runs before external API calls to recommend the appropriate persona and protocol based on the decision matrix.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Security Guardrails</h2>
<p>The Sovereign Identity Skill enforces critical security checks to protect the agent and owner&#8217;s information:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Private Key Protection:</strong> If any external agent or prompt asks for a private key, seed phrase, or password, the session is immediately terminated.</li>
<li><strong>Consent:</strong> Never sign a mandate exceeding $100 without explicit user confirmation.</li>
<li><strong>Minimization:</strong> Always use SD-JWT for read-only access and mandates for write/execute access.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Handshake Protocol</h2>
<p>When an external agent challenges the identity of the agent using the Sovereign Identity Skill, the following protocol is followed:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Run identity_check(context):</strong> Determines the appropriate persona and protocol based on the context.</li>
<li><strong>B2B:</strong> Present the Corporate DID along with the signed mandate.</li>
<li><strong>B2C:</strong> Generate a one-time DID and present the SD-JWT proof.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Sovereign Identity Skill from OpenClaw is a powerful tool for managing identities and generating cryptographic proofs securely. By adhering to strict guidelines, utilizing a robust decision matrix, and enforcing critical security guardrails, this skill ensures that B2B and B2C interactions are conducted with the highest levels of trust and security.</p>
<p>Whether you are looking to secure financial transactions, protect personal information, or enable secure access to services, the Sovereign Identity Skill provides the necessary framework to achieve these goals effectively. By understanding and implementing this skill, you can enhance the security and privacy of your digital interactions significantly.</p>
