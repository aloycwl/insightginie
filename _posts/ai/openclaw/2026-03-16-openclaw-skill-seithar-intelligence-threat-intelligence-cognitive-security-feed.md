<h2>Introduction to Seithar Intelligence Skill</h2>
<p>Seithar Intelligence is a sophisticated OpenClaw skill that transforms your agent into a personal cyber threat intelligence analyst. This skill monitors cybersecurity and cognitive security feeds, scores items against your configured interests, delivers daily briefings, and provides on-demand deep-dive analysis of any threat &#8211; whether technical or cognitive in nature.</p>
<p>Think of it as having ThreatMouth in your pocket, providing cyber + cognitive security awareness from any chat application you use with OpenClaw.</p>
<h2>What This Skill Does</h2>
<p>The Seithar Intelligence skill turns your OpenClaw into a comprehensive threat intelligence analyst that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monitors multiple cybersecurity RSS feeds including BleepingComputer, The Hacker News, Krebs on Security, CISA, Full Disclosure, Exploit-DB, SANS ISC, oss-security, Schneier, PacketStorm, DarkReading, and more</li>
<li>Monitors cognitive security feeds including EUvsDisinfo, DFRLab, Bellingcat, RAND, and Seithar Research</li>
<li>Scores each feed item against your configured interest profile to determine relevance</li>
<li>Delivers morning and evening briefings via your preferred chat application</li>
<li>Provides on-demand deep-dive analysis of any CVE, vulnerability, exploit, influence operation, or campaign</li>
<li>Maps items to MITRE ATT&amp;CK and DISARM framework techniques</li>
<li>Discovers public proof-of-concept code for disclosed vulnerabilities</li>
<li>Maintains a running threat landscape summary that evolves with the feed</li>
</ul>
<h2>Getting Started with Seithar Intelligence</h2>
<p>Setting up the Seithar Intelligence skill is straightforward. You&#8217;ll need to configure your interest profile, set up briefing schedules, and define what types of threats you want to monitor most closely.</p>
<h3>Configuring Your Interest Profile</h3>
<p>The skill works best when it understands your specific security interests. You should configure your OpenClaw with a detailed interest profile. Here&#8217;s an example of what you might tell your OpenClaw:</p>
<p><em>My security interests are:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Malware analysis and reverse engineering</li>
<li>Social engineering and cognitive security</li>
<li>Network exploitation</li>
<li>OSINT and intelligence gathering</li>
<li>Influence operations and information warfare</li>
<li>Vulnerability research and exploit development</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I&#8217;m currently studying:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework</li>
<li>DISARM framework for influence operations</li>
<li>Python security tooling</li>
<li>OverTheWire wargames</li>
</ul>
<p><em>My skill level:</em> intermediate</p>
<p><em>Deprioritize:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Enterprise compliance and GRC</li>
<li>Cloud IAM and AWS security</li>
<li>Vendor marketing announcements</li>
<li>Corporate breach notifications unless technically interesting</li>
</ul>
<p>The skill stores this profile in memory and uses it to score every feed item for relevance, ensuring you only receive the most pertinent information.</p>
<h3>Setting Up Briefings</h3>
<p>The skill provides two main types of briefings: scheduled briefings and on-demand queries. By default, the skill operates on this schedule:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Morning briefing:</strong> 8:00 AM local time &#8211; Top 5 items from overnight, any critical alerts</li>
<li><strong>Evening briefing:</strong> 6:00 PM local time &#8211; Day summary, items scored above 0.7, study recommendations</li>
<li><strong>Critical alerts:</strong> Immediate &#8211; Items scored above 0.9 pushed as soon as detected</li>
</ul>
<p>You can customize these times by telling your OpenClaw: &#8220;Change my briefing time to 9 AM and 7 PM&#8221; or &#8220;Only send critical alerts, no scheduled briefings.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Feed Check Interval</h3>
<p>By default, the skill checks feeds every 2 hours using OpenClaw&#8217;s cron/heartbeat system to periodically fetch and process new content. This ensures you stay up-to-date without being overwhelmed by constant notifications.</p>
<h2>How Seithar Intelligence Works</h2>
<p>Understanding the inner workings of this skill helps you appreciate how it delivers such targeted and valuable intelligence.</p>
<h3>Feed Collection Process</h3>
<p>On each check interval, the skill instructs the agent to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fetch RSS feeds from the configured source list using the web_fetch tool</li>
<li>Parse feed entries (title, link, published date, summary/description)</li>
<li>Deduplicate against previously seen items (tracked in memory by URL hash)</li>
<li>For each new item, score it against the operator&#8217;s interest profile</li>
</ol>
<h3>Scoring System</h3>
<p>Each new item is scored on a scale from 0.0 to 1.0 against your profile:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>0.9 &#8211; 1.0:</strong> Critical &#8211; Matches core interests directly, high urgency (active exploitation, 0-day, major campaign)</li>
<li><strong>0.7 &#8211; 0.9:</strong> High &#8211; Relevant to interests, worth reading today</li>
<li><strong>0.5 &#8211; 0.7:</strong> Medium &#8211; Tangentially relevant, include in digest</li>
<li><strong>Below 0.5:</strong> Low &#8211; Skip unless specifically requested</li>
</ul>
<p>The agent scores by examining the item&#8217;s title, summary, source, and any CVE/technique references against your stored interest profile. No external API is needed &#8211; the LLM does the scoring inline.</p>
<h3>Categorization System</h3>
<p>Items are automatically categorized into:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CRITICAL ALERT:</strong> Active exploitation, 0-day, critical infrastructure</li>
<li><strong>EXPLOIT DROP:</strong> New CVE, PoC release, vulnerability disclosure</li>
<li><strong>MALWARE:</strong> Malware analysis, RE findings, campaign reports</li>
<li><strong>INFLUENCE OP:</strong> Disinformation campaigns, cognitive security, DISARM-mapped operations</li>
<li><strong>TECHNIQUE:</strong> ATT&amp;CK or DISARM technique deep-dives, methodology</li>
<li><strong>LEARNING:</strong> Tutorials, CTF writeups, educational content</li>
<li><strong>GENERAL:</strong> Industry news, policy, commentary</li>
</ul>
<h2>Daily Briefings</h2>
<p>The skill delivers comprehensive briefings in a structured format that makes it easy to quickly understand the threat landscape.</p>
<h3>Morning Briefing Format</h3>

<h2>On-Demand Deep Dive Analysis</h2>
<p>When you need more detailed information about a specific threat, the skill provides comprehensive deep-dive analysis.</p>
<h3>Requesting a Deep Dive</h3>
<p>You can request deep dives using various triggers:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;deep dive [topic]&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;explain CVE-XXXX-XXXXX&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;analyze this threat&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;what should I study today&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Deep Dive Process</h3>
<p>When you request a deep dive, the skill:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fetches the full article content via web_fetch</li>
<li>If a CVE is mentioned, queries the NVD API for structured vulnerability data</li>
<li>Searches GitHub for public PoC repositories using the GitHub API</li>
<li>Generates a structured educational breakdown</li>
</ol>
<h3>Deep Dive Format</h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example of what a deep dive might look like:</p>
<pre><code>╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  SEITHAR DEEP DIVE                               ║
║  CVE-2026-XXXXX — OpenSSH Pre-Auth RCE           ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
WHAT HAPPENED:
A memory corruption vulnerability in OpenSSH's key exchange
handler allows unauthenticated attackers to achieve remote
code execution as root. No credentials required.
HOW THE EXPLOIT WORKS:
1. Attacker connects to SSH port 22
2. During key exchange (before authentication), sends
   oversized payload in the KEX_INIT message
3. Buffer overflow overwrites return address on stack
4. Execution redirected to attacker's shellcode
5. Root shell achieved
IMPACT ASSESSMENT:
- CVSS: 9.8/10 (Critical)
- Affects: OpenSSH 9.x, 8.x (some versions)
- No authentication required
- Can be performed anonymously
- Complete system compromise
MITRE ATT&amp;CK MAPPING:
- T1190: Exploitation for Defense Evasion
- T1068: Exploitation for Privilege Escalation
- T1059.004: PowerShell (if used in post-exploit)
DISARM FRAMEWORK:
- Not applicable (technical vulnerability)
POC ANALYSIS:
- Public PoC available on GitHub
- Written in Python 3.9+
- Requires network access to target
- Works against default SSH configurations
RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Apply patches immediately
- Monitor SSH logs for unusual key exchange attempts
- Consider network segmentation
- Review SSH hardening guides
RELATED THREATS:
- Similar vulnerabilities in other SSH implementations
- Potential for wormable exploitation
- Active exploitation in the wild
