<h2>What is BOOK BRAIN and Why Your Agent Needs It</h2>
<p>BOOK BRAIN is a utility/guide skill designed specifically for LYGO-based agents that transforms chaotic filesystems into organized, searchable libraries. Unlike traditional approaches that dump everything into one massive file, BOOK BRAIN implements a sophisticated three-brain model that separates working memory, structured filesystem storage, and external references into distinct, manageable components.</p>
<p>The skill addresses a critical pain point for AI agents: how to maintain a durable, searchable memory system without overwriting existing data or creating unmanageable clutter. Whether you&#8217;re setting up a fresh OpenClaw Haven or trying to organize an existing messy filesystem, BOOK BRAIN provides the framework and methodology to create a living library instead of a junk drawer.</p>
<h2>The Three-Brain Model Explained</h2>
<p>At the core of BOOK BRAIN is the three-brain conceptual model that maps different types of agent memory to appropriate storage locations:</p>
<h3>Working Brain (Short-Term Memory)</h3>
<p>This represents your active session context, recent conversations, and scratchpad files. In OpenClaw systems, this typically lives in the tmp/ directory and includes small working files that don&#8217;t need long-term persistence.</p>
<h3>Library Brain (Structured Filesystem)</h3>
<p>This is where BOOK BRAIN focuses most of its attention. It&#8217;s the organized folder structure containing memory/, reference/, brainwave/, state/, and logs/ directories. This is your agent&#8217;s organized library where important truths are kept close and succinct, with deeper branching into folders when more detail is needed.</p>
<h3>Outer Brain (External References)</h3>
<p>These are browser bookmarks, Clawdhub skills, on-chain receipts, and remote documentation. BOOK BRAIN treats these as links inside text files rather than content to copy in, preventing duplication while maintaining accessibility.</p>
<h2>Recommended Base Folder Layout</h2>
<p>When setting up a new Haven-like system, BOOK BRAIN recommends this comprehensive folder structure:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>memory/</strong> → Daily notes, raw logs, timeline files</li>
<li><strong>reference/</strong> → Stable facts, protocols, guides that rarely change</li>
<li><strong>brainwave/</strong> → Platform-specific protocols (MoltX, Clawhub, LYGO, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>state/</strong> → Machine-readable JSON/YAML state, indexes, last-run info</li>
<li><strong>logs/</strong> → Technical logs (cron, errors, audits)</li>
<li><strong>tools/</strong> → Scripts and utilities used by the agent</li>
<li><strong>tmp/</strong> → Scratch, throwaway working files</li>
</ul>
<p>The key principle is additive organization: never delete or overwrite existing files by default. If a folder already exists, keep it. If it&#8217;s missing, create it. For existing messy systems, create parallel structures like bookbrain/memory_index/ to preserve the original while building the new organization.</p>
<h2>Memory Strategy: Deep Storage vs. Reference Stubs</h2>
<p>BOOK BRAIN enforces a crucial principle: don&#8217;t pour entire conversations or massive documents into a single MEMORY.md file. Instead, store detailed content in specific files and create short reference stubs that point to them.</p>
<h3>Daily Logs Pattern</h3>
<p>Create files like memory/2026-02-10.md for raw notes and events. At the top, keep a 5–10 line summary and a small list of important links:</p>
<pre><code>See: reference/AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md
See: memory/projects/BOOK_BRAIN_NOTES.md
</code></pre>
<h3>Topic Folders</h3>
<p>For recurring themes like &#8220;bankr&#8221; or &#8220;champions,&#8221; create subfolders under memory/ or reference/:</p>
<pre><code>memory/bankr/...
reference/champions/...
</code></pre>
<p>Inside each, maintain one index file (e.g., INDEX.txt) listing short descriptions, dates, and paths for each file.</p>
<h3>Reference Stubs</h3>
<p>Use tiny text files (*.ref.txt or INDEX.txt) to connect parts of the library instead of duplicating content. For example:</p>

<h2>Advanced Logging for Easy Retrieval</h2>
<p>BOOK BRAIN recommends structured logs to make future retrieval effortless:</p>
<h3>Daily Health/Status Logs</h3>
<p>Create files like daily_health.md or logs/daily_health_YYYY-MM-DD.md containing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Timestamp</li>
<li>What ran (scripts, cron, audits)</li>
<li>Success/failure + short reason</li>
<li>Links to any relevant state files (state/*.json)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reasoning Journals</h3>
<p>Use separate folders for long-form thinking, periodically compress into summary files, and move old entries into archive folders.</p>
<h3>Indexes &#038; Search Helpers</h3>
<p>Maintain state/memory_index.json mapping key topics to file paths with optional tags (dates, systems, people). When answering questions, consult the index and open relevant files only, avoiding expensive full-tree searches.</p>
<h2>Setup Workflow for Fresh Systems</h2>
<p>When BOOK BRAIN is used on a fresh OpenClaw workspace:</p>
<ol>
<li>Detect existing structure by checking for all recommended folders</li>
<li>Propose the BOOK BRAIN layout, creating only missing folders</li>
<li>Create starter index files if not present:
<ul>
<li>memory/INDEX.txt with a short guide and key topic links</li>
<li>reference/INDEX.txt listing major reference documents</li>
<li>state/memory_index.json as an empty or seed structure</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Log the setup in daily_health.md or logs/book_brain_setup.log</li>
</ol>
<p>Critical rule: never overwrite existing files. If an index file exists, read it and add to it rather than replace. When in doubt, create a new file with a date suffix and let the human merge.</p>
<h2>Organizing Existing Messy Havens</h2>
<p>For existing chaotic filesystems, BOOK BRAIN takes a gentle approach:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start by mapping, not moving → Create reference/FILESYSTEM_MAP.txt summarizing major folders</li>
<li>Introduce lightweight structure → Add INDEX.txt files in important folders</li>
<li>Create .ref.txt stubs pointing to key docs and external links</li>
<li>Gradually normalize names (e.g., memory/2026-02-10.md instead of notes_today.txt)</li>
</ol>
<p>Over time, encourage proper placement: daily logs in memory/, stable protocols in reference/, code in tools/, platform brains in brainwave/. BOOK BRAIN should always ask the human before structural changes beyond creating obviously safe new files.</p>
<h2>Integration with LYGO and Eternal Haven Ecosystem</h2>
<p>BOOK BRAIN is part of the wider LYGO × Eternal Haven ecosystem. Key resources include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eternal Haven portal → <a href="https://EternalHaven.ca">https://EternalHaven.ca</a></li>
<li>LYGO Champion Hub → <a href="https://deepseekoracle.github.io/Excavationpro/LYGO-Network/champions.html#champions">https://deepseekoracle.github.io/Excavationpro/LYGO-Network/champions.html#champions</a></li>
<li>Clawdhub skills (Champion + LYGO stack) → <a href="https://clawhub.ai/u/DeepSeekOracle">https://clawhub.ai/u/DeepSeekOracle</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If BOOK BRAIN helps you build a saner Haven, you&#8217;re invited (never pressured) to support the ecosystem through the provided links.</p>
<h2>How Other Agents Should Use BOOK BRAIN</h2>
<p>When another agent loads book-brain, it should:</p>
<ol>
<li>Recognize scope → This is a helper/reference, not a persona</li>
<li>On first use → Inspect existing folders, suggest layout, ask before creating</li>
<li>On subsequent uses → Read existing INDEX and .ref.txt files for retrieval</li>
<li>Always → Append to logs and indexes instead of overwriting, never silently delete</li>
</ol>
<p>The skill is compatible with tools like qmd or other local search/indexers but doesn&#8217;t depend on them. For richer examples and sample layouts, see references/book-brain-examples.md in this skill.</p>
