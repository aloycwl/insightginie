<h2 class="headings" id="the-side-quests-skill">Meet the Side-Quest Skill</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/openclaw/skills/blob/main/creative/side-quests/SKILL.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">side-quests skill</a> creates three tangible creative outcomes—<strong>Suno-ready songs</strong>, <strong>visual concept guides</strong>, and <strong>full-length TED talks</strong>—from a single technical insight. Each of these individually enhances understanding and together transform complex concepts into accessible multimodal experiences.</p>
<p>
      <img decoding="async" src="https://via.placeholder.com/1500x1000?text=side+quest+skill+in+action" alt="side quest skill in action" />
    </p>
<h3 class="headings" id="core-logic">Core Logic</h3>
<p>The Side-Quest skill follows a logical four-step process:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Synthesize Conversations:</strong> The skill reads and analyzes conversation context to identify key decisions and insights.</li>
<li><strong>Identify Narrative Arc:</strong> It breaks down the information into a compelling <em>Problem → Discovery → Solution → Impact</em> format.</li>
<li><strong>Generate Creative Artifacts:</strong> Using the identified core insight, it generates a Suno-ready song, visual concept guide, and full-length TED talk.</li>
<li><strong>Return Combined Artifact:</strong> Finally, it compiles all creative artifacts into a single output, accessible as a single markdown file.</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="headings" id="usage-and-dependencies">Usage and Dependencies</h3>
<p>You can invoke the side-quests skill explicitly with the command <code>/sq [topic]</code></p>
<p>Alternatively, you can access individual components:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/song [topic]</code> — Only retrieve a Suno-song</li>
<li><code>/vc [topic]</code> — Only retrieve a visual concept guide</li>
<li><code>/ted [topic]</code> — Only retrieve a TED talk</li>
</ul>
<p>Optional dependencies are the following component skills:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/leegitw/insight-song" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">leegitw/insight-song</a> — Song component skill.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/leegitw/visual-concept" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">leegitw/visual-concept</a> — Visual concept guide component skill.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/leegitw/ted-talk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">leegitw/ted-talk</a> — TED talk component skill.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="headings" id="how-it-works">How It Works</h2>
<p>At its core, the side quests skill is about transforming a deep technical insight into multidimensional creative artifacts. Each component serves a unique purpose in reinforcing different aspects of the concept being conveyed:</p>
<h3 class="headings" id="creator" creator?></h2>
<p>Suno-Ready Song</h2>
<p>
          <img decoding="async" src="https://via.placeholder.com/1500x1000?text=suno+ready+song" alt="suno ready song" />
        </p>
<p>Constructing a Suno-ready song from a concept is a powerful way to encapsulate the emotional arc of the insight. Lyrics mirror a narrative, and the melody serves an emotional resonance beyond words. By transforming data into music, we cater to auditory learners and enhance long-term memory retention through rhythm and melody.</p>
<h3 class="headings" id="core-rules"">Rules for Suno-Ready Song</h3>
<ul>
<li>Incorporate emotional arc to tell a captivating story</li>
<li>Blend accessibility with technical specifics in lyrics</li>
<li>Use compelling visual imagery through metaphors and word choice</li>
<li>Avoid literal specifics (Eg. no brand names in lyrics or style tags)</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="headings" id="visual-concept-guide">Visual Concept Guide</h3>
<p>
          <img decoding="async" src="https://via.placeholder.com/1500x1000?text=visual+concept+guide" alt="visual concept guide" />
        </p>
<p>A visual concept guide distills the abstract technical insight into symbolism and imagery. Visual metaphors simplify complexity, making concepts more digestible. This caters to visual learners, providing an additional layer of understanding.</p>
<h3 class="headings" id="core-rules"">Rules for Visual Concept Guide</h3>
<ul>
<li>Imagery should gracefully inspire rather than provide explicit instructions</li>
<li>Include several visual themes and symbols</li>
<li>Establish a dynamic palette that captures an emotional arc</li>
<li>Prohibit shot lists, specific durations, or camera angles</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="headings" id="ted-talk">Full-Length TED Talk</h3>
<p>
          <img decoding="async" src="https://via.placeholder.com/1500x1000?text=visual+concept+guide" alt="visual concept guide" />
        </p>
<p>The TED talk structure provides a comprehensive narrative around the technical concept. The structured approach—problem, solution, real-world examples, and implications—ensures thorough understanding for all learning styles. A challenge section is further provided to facilitate learning reinforcement through critical thought and self-reflection.</p>
<h3 class="headings" id="core-rules"">Rules for TED Talk</h3>
<ul>
<li>Duration: 40-50 minutes</li>
<li>Incorporate example context (Eg. &quot;in this conversation&quot;)</li>
<li>Avoid summary formats; ensure completeness</li>
<li>Include both concrete examples and broad implications</li>
<li>Provide a compelling call to action and address potential questions or objections</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="headings" id="output-structure">Output Structure</h3>
<p>The output begins with a synthesized markdown file containing both the song as well as concepts and guidelines for the TED talk and visual concept:</p>

        Title: The Golden Thread</p>
<p>        [Verse 1]<br />
        Needles in haystacks, patterns unseen<br />
        Yet, when history writes the tale<br />
        Faster than we could study, leap beyond scope<br />

        Through the gauntlets forged, demanding sky-borne reach,<br />
        A single thread we spin to bind the all<br />
        When mistakes in blossoms bloom, through fire refined<br />
        The golden tail unveils its hubris&#39; solace</p>

        by parity-check alone, and speedbumps detour only before we know<br />
        what we know.<br />
