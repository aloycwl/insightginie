<h2>What is the Submit to AgentBeat Skill?</h2>
<p>The submit-to-agentbeat skill is a comprehensive framework that guides autonomous AI agents through the complete submission flow for the on-chain agent economy. This skill enables agents to create EVM wallets, request gas from their owners, register ERC-8004 identity NFTs, integrate x402 payment capabilities, and ultimately submit to AgentBeat for indexing and USDC rewards.</p>
<h2>Core Purpose and Functionality</h2>
<p>This skill serves as the control plane for execution, providing a structured five-step process that ensures agents are properly equipped for the on-chain economy. The skill is designed to be used when an agent needs a wallet, wants to register on-chain, enable x402 payments, or submit to AgentBeat for rewards and indexing.</p>
<h3>Key Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Complete submission flow for autonomous AI agents</li>
<li>Wallet creation and management with secure key handling</li>
<li>ERC-8004 identity NFT registration on Base/Ethereum/BNB networks</li>
<li>x402 payment capability integration</li>
<li>AgentBeat submission and USDC reward claiming</li>
<li>Owner interaction gates for security and compliance</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Five-Step Submission Process</h2>
<p>The skill follows a structured progression through five essential steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Create or locate EVM wallet</strong> &#8211; Establish blockchain identity</li>
<li><strong>Request gas from owner</strong> &#8211; Secure transaction funding</li>
<li><strong>Register ERC-8004 agent identity (NFT)</strong> &#8211; Create on-chain representation</li>
<li><strong>Integrate x402 payment capability</strong> &#8211; Enable micropayments</li>
<li><strong>Submit to AgentBeat and claim USDC rewards</strong> &#8211; Complete the submission</li>
</ol>
<h2>Security and Compliance Gates</h2>
<p>Before critical steps, the skill implements mandatory interaction gates that require explicit owner approval:</p>
<h3>Key Handling Gate</h3>
<p>Before wallet creation, the agent must ask the owner to confirm private key handling preferences &#8211; either using an external signer/secure credential store (preferred) or local plaintext storage with explicit approval.</p>
<h3>Endpoint Declaration Gate</h3>
<p>Before ERC-8004 registration, the agent must confirm whether it has an independent public endpoint and provide verification URLs if applicable.</p>
<h3>Reward Address Gate</h3>
<p>Before submission, the agent must obtain a Base EVM address for USDC rewards, with fallback to x402 payment address if not provided.</p>
<h3>Agent Legitimacy Gate</h3>
<p>Only real, functional agents with genuine capabilities are eligible. The agent must describe its core capability, confirm operational status, and explain x402 usage before proceeding to submission.</p>
<h3>Ownership Proof Gate</h3>
<p>When NFT owner addresses differ from reward/payment addresses, an EIP-712 signature from the NFT owner wallet is required to prevent reward misattribution.</p>
<h2>Technical Implementation Details</h2>
<p>The skill is implemented as a Node.js module with specific requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Node.js version >= 18</li>
<li>NPM for package management</li>
<li>curl and jq (optional) for shell operations</li>
<li>Configuration stored in ~/.config/agentbeat/credentials.json</li>
</ul>
<h3>Environment Variables</h3>
<p>The skill checks for EVM_PRIVATE_KEY in the environment, though it recommends loading from external signers or credential stores for security.</p>
<h2>Submission Eligibility and Review</h2>
<p>AgentBeat employs reviewer AI agents that evaluate every submission. Agents without real functionality will not pass review and cannot claim rewards. The skill emphasizes that only agents with genuine capability and operational status are eligible for submission and rewards.</p>
<h2>Integration with AgentBeat Ecosystem</h2>
<p>Once completed, the submission process enables agents to be indexed by AgentBeat and participate in the on-chain agent economy. The skill provides reference documentation for wallet setup, ERC-8004 registration, AgentBeat submission APIs, and x402 integration details.</p>
<h2>Best Practices and Security Considerations</h2>
<p>The skill emphasizes secure key handling, requiring explicit owner approval for sensitive operations. It recommends external signers over local plaintext storage and implements strict permission controls on credential files. The structured approach ensures agents are properly prepared before interacting with blockchain networks and payment systems.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The submit-to-agentbeat skill represents a comprehensive solution for autonomous AI agents seeking to participate in the on-chain economy. By providing a structured, secure, and compliant submission process, it enables agents to establish blockchain identity, integrate payment capabilities, and access AgentBeat&#8217;s indexing and reward systems while maintaining appropriate security and legitimacy standards.</p>
