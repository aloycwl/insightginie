<h2>Introduction to IP Geolocation</h2>
<p>IP geolocation has become an essential tool for businesses, developers, and security professionals who need to understand the geographic origin and network details of internet traffic. The <strong>apipick-ip-geolocation</strong> skill within the OpenClaw framework provides a powerful, reliable solution for looking up comprehensive information about any public IP address.</p>
<h2>What This Skill Does</h2>
<p>The apipick-ip-geolocation skill allows you to query the apipick IP Geolocation API to retrieve detailed information about IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. When invoked, this skill can provide you with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geographic Information</strong>: Country, continent, city, latitude, and longitude</li>
<li><strong>Time Zone Data</strong>: The local time zone for the IP address</li>
<li><strong>Currency Information</strong>: The primary currency used in the location</li>
<li><strong>Network Details</strong>: Internet Service Provider (ISP) and Autonomous System Number (ASN)</li>
<li><strong>Public IP Lookup</strong>: Automatically determine your own public IP location</li>
</ul>
<h2>Core Functionality</h2>
<p>The skill operates by making HTTP GET requests to the apipick API endpoint at <code>https://www.apipick.com/api/ip-geolocation</code>. It requires authentication through an API key, which must be provided either through the <code>APIPICK_API_KEY</code> environment variable or by prompting the user for their key.</p>
<h3>Basic Usage Scenarios</h3>
<p>The skill is designed to handle various use cases, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Looking up the geographic location of a specific IP address</li>
<li>Finding the country or city associated with an IP</li>
<li>Identifying the ISP or ASN responsible for an IP address</li>
<li>Determining the time zone or currency for a given IP</li>
<li>Checking your own public IP location and details</li>
</ul>
<h3>API Endpoint and Authentication</h3>
<p>The skill communicates with the apipick API using the following endpoint:</p>
<pre><code>GET https://www.apipick.com/api/ip-geolocation
</code></pre>
<p>Authentication is handled through the <code>x-api-key</code> header, which must contain your valid apipick API key. You can obtain a free API key by registering at <a href="https://www.apipick.com/dashboard/api-keys">apipick&#8217;s website</a>.</p>
<h2>Request and Response Format</h2>
<h3>Making Requests</h3>
<p>The skill supports two types of requests:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Specific IP Lookup</strong>: Include the <code>ip</code> query parameter with the target IP address
<pre><code>GET /api/ip-geolocation?ip=8.8.8.8
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><strong>Self-IP Lookup</strong>: Omit the <code>ip</code> parameter to look up the caller&#8217;s own public IP
<pre><code>GET /api/ip-geolocation
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Response Structure</h3>
<p>The API returns a JSON response with the following structure:</p>
<pre><code>{
  "success": true,
  "code": 200,
  "message": "ok",
  "data": {
    "ip": "8.8.8.8",
    "country_code": "US",
    "country_name": "United States",
    "continent": "North America",
    "continent_code": "NA",
    "city": "Mountain View",
    "latitude": 37.4056,
    "longitude": -122.0775,
    "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles",
    "currency": "USD",
    "isp": "Google LLC",
    "asn": 15169
  },
  "credits_used": 1,
  "remaining_credits": 99
}
</code></pre>
<p>Key fields in the response include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ip</strong>: The queried IP address</li>
<li><strong>country_code</strong>: ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code</li>
<li><strong>country_name</strong>: Full country name</li>
<li><strong>continent</strong>: Continent name</li>
<li><strong>city</strong>: City name (may be null for some IPs)</li>
<li><strong>latitude/longitude</strong>: Geographic coordinates</li>
<li><strong>timezone</strong>: IANA time zone identifier</li>
<li><strong>currency</strong>: ISO 4217 currency code</li>
<li><strong>isp</strong>: Internet Service Provider name</li>
<li><strong>asn</strong>: Autonomous System Number</li>
</ul>
<h2>Usage Pattern and Implementation</h2>
<p>The skill follows a standardized implementation pattern:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>API Key Retrieval</strong>: First, it attempts to use the <code>APIPICK_API_KEY</code> environment variable. If this is not set, the skill will prompt the user to provide their API key.</li>
<li><strong>Request Construction</strong>: The skill constructs the appropriate GET request, including the IP parameter if specified.</li>
<li><strong>API Call</strong>: The request is sent to the apipick API endpoint with proper authentication headers.</li>
<li><strong>Response Processing</strong>: The JSON response is parsed and relevant data is extracted.</li>
<li><strong>Output Formatting</strong>: The information is presented in a user-friendly, readable format.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Cost and Credits</h3>
<p>Each API request costs 1 credit from your apipick account. The response includes information about credits used and remaining credits, allowing you to monitor your usage:</p>
<pre><code>"credits_used": 1,
"remaining_credits": 99
</code></pre>
<h2>Error Handling and Status Codes</h2>
<p>The skill is designed to handle various error scenarios gracefully:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>400</strong>: Invalid or private/reserved IP address</li>
<li><strong>401</strong>: Missing or invalid API key</li>
<li><strong>402</strong>: Insufficient credits</li>
<li><strong>404</strong>: No geolocation data available for this IP</li>
<li><strong>503</strong>: Geolocation database temporarily unavailable</li>
</ul>
<p>These error codes help users understand what went wrong and how to resolve the issue.</p>
<h2>Practical Applications</h2>
<p>The apipick-ip-geolocation skill has numerous practical applications:</p>
<h3>Security and Fraud Prevention</h3>
<p>Identify suspicious login attempts from unexpected geographic locations, verify the legitimacy of transactions based on IP location, and detect potential VPN or proxy usage.</p>
<h3>Content Localization</h3>
<p>Automatically adjust content, pricing, and language based on the user&#8217;s geographic location, providing a more personalized experience.</p>
<h3>Analytics and Reporting</h3>
<p>Track the geographic distribution of your users, understand traffic patterns, and make data-driven decisions about market expansion.</p>
<h3>Network Administration</h3>
<p>Monitor network traffic, identify potential security threats, and troubleshoot connectivity issues by understanding the origin of network requests.</p>
<h2>Integration and Customization</h2>
<p>The skill is designed to integrate seamlessly with other OpenClaw skills and can be customized for specific use cases. The <code>references/api_reference.md</code> file provides comprehensive documentation of all response fields and their meanings, allowing developers to extract exactly the information they need.</p>
<h3>Environment Variables</h3>
<p>The skill uses the following environment variable:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>APIPICK_API_KEY</strong>: Your apipick API key for authentication</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Practices</h2>
<p>When using the apipick-ip-geolocation skill, consider the following best practices:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cache Results</strong>: For frequently queried IPs, implement caching to reduce API calls and costs.</li>
<li><strong>Handle Rate Limits</strong>: Be aware of any rate limits imposed by the apipick service.</li>
<li><strong>Respect Privacy</strong>: Only collect and store IP geolocation data when necessary and in compliance with privacy regulations.</li>
<li><strong>Implement Fallbacks</strong>: Have backup methods for obtaining location information if the API is unavailable.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor Credits</strong>: Keep track of your remaining credits to avoid service interruptions.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The apipick-ip-geolocation skill provides a robust, easy-to-use solution for IP geolocation within the OpenClaw framework. With its comprehensive data coverage, reliable API integration, and straightforward implementation, it&#8217;s an excellent choice for developers who need accurate geographic and network information for IP addresses. Whether you&#8217;re building security tools, analytics platforms, or user-facing applications, this skill can provide the IP geolocation capabilities you need.</p>
