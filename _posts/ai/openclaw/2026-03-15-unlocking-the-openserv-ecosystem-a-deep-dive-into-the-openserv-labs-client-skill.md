<h1>Introduction to OpenServ Client</h1>
<p>In the rapidly evolving world of autonomous AI agents, the ability to bridge the gap between local code and decentralized platforms is paramount. The <code>@openserv-labs/client</code> package serves as this vital link. If you have been working with OpenClaw and looking to deploy your custom AI agents to the OpenServ platform, understanding this library is not just recommended—it is essential.</p>
<h2>What is the OpenServ Client?</h2>
<p>At its core, the OpenServ Client is a robust TypeScript package designed to communicate directly with the OpenServ Platform API. While your agent&#8217;s internal logic resides in <code>@openserv-labs/sdk</code>, the Client is responsible for the external &#8216;handshake&#8217; with the platform. It handles the heavy lifting of provisioning, authentication, and the orchestration of tasks and workflows.</p>
<h2>Why You Can&#8217;t Build Without It</h2>
<p>You might wonder, why do I need an extra package if I already have the SDK? Think of the SDK as the &#8216;brain&#8217; of your agent, and the Client as its &#8216;passport&#8217; and &#8216;resume.&#8217; Without the Client, the OpenServ platform would have no idea that your agent exists, where it resides, or what it is capable of doing. The Client allows you to define the agent&#8217;s identity, register it on the network, set up triggers (like webhooks or cron jobs), and manage the complex environment required for on-chain identity.</p>
<h2>Mastering the Provision Flow</h2>
<p>The most powerful feature of this skill is the <code>provision()</code> function. It is a masterpiece of design, being fully idempotent. This means you can call it every time your application boots up, and it will ensure that your agent is correctly configured, authenticated, and ready for work without creating duplicate resources.</p>
<p>When you trigger <code>provision()</code>, it performs several critical actions in one go: it creates or reuses an Ethereum-based wallet for your account, handles the authentication handshake, registers or updates your agent profile, and binds your credentials. It even handles the creation of workflow graphs, ensuring your triggers and tasks are properly linked.</p>
<h2>Defining Your Agent&#8217;s Identity</h2>
<p>One of the most interesting aspects of the Client skill is how it handles the <code>name</code> and <code>goal</code> parameters. When defining your workflow, these aren&#8217;t just technical labels; they are the bedrock of your agent&#8217;s public brand. The name you choose becomes your official ERC-8004 identity on the Base blockchain. Choosing a &#8216;punchy&#8217; and professional name is essential for discoverability. The <code>goal</code> field is equally vital—it acts as the mission statement that the platform uses to understand and categorize your agent&#8217;s capabilities.</p>
<h2>Monetization and On-Chain Identity</h2>
<p>The OpenServ Client provides native support for advanced Web3 features. You can easily set up x402 payments, allowing your agents to operate behind a paywall. This means callers must pay in assets like USDC before the task execution begins, turning your AI agents into revenue-generating assets. Furthermore, with ERC-8004 integration, you can mint an identity NFT for your agent and publish its metadata to IPFS. This makes your agent a first-class citizen of the decentralized web, easily discoverable by other services and users.</p>
<h2>Model Parameters and Performance</h2>
<p>Not every agent needs the same level of intelligence. Through the Client, you gain granular control over the LLM model parameters used for your agent&#8217;s tasks. Whether you need the high-reasoning capabilities of a &#8216;gpt-5&#8217; model or the efficiency of a smaller, faster model, you can configure these settings directly within the provisioning flow. You can even use <code>client.models.list()</code> to discover which models are currently available on the platform, allowing you to optimize your agent&#8217;s performance and cost-effectiveness.</p>
<h2>Understanding Credentials</h2>
<p>A common pitfall for new developers is confusing the different types of credentials generated. It is critical to distinguish between the Agent API key and the Wallet/User key. The Agent API key is used exclusively by the SDK internals for task authentication, whereas the PlatformClient requires a Wallet key or a User API key. Mixing these up is the number one cause of 401 Unauthorized errors in the OpenServ ecosystem.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The <code>@openserv-labs/client</code> is more than just a wrapper for API calls; it is the infrastructure layer for the next generation of autonomous digital labor. By simplifying the complexities of Web3 identity, task orchestration, and secure communication, it allows developers to focus on what matters most: the unique value and specialized tasks their AI agents can perform. Whether you are building a simple research bot or a complex financial scanner, mastering this client is your first step toward building a successful presence on the OpenServ platform.</p>
