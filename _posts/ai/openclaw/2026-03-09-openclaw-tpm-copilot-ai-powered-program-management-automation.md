<h1>OpenClaw TPM Copilot: Revolutionizing Program Management with AI</h1>
<p>The <strong>TPM Copilot</strong> skill from OpenClaw represents a significant leap forward in program management automation. This AI-powered operating system is specifically designed for Technical Program Managers and Project Managers who need to orchestrate complex initiatives across multiple teams and tools. By integrating data from Jira, Linear, GitHub, and calendars, the TPM Copilot automates critical workflows that traditionally consumed hours of manual effort.</p>
<h2>What the TPM Copilot Skill Does</h2>
<p>The TPM Copilot skill functions as your AI program management operator, synthesizing information from connected tools to generate status reports, track risks and blockers, manage meeting workflows, map dependencies, and deliver stakeholder dashboards. It&#8217;s designed to eliminate the manual overhead that typically burdens program managers, allowing them to focus on strategic decision-making rather than data collection and report generation.</p>
<h3>Core Capabilities</h3>
<p>The skill offers five primary workflows that address the most time-consuming aspects of program management:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Status Report Generator</strong> &#8211; Automatically creates audience-specific reports pulling from all connected tools</li>
<li><strong>Risk &amp; Blocker Radar</strong> &#8211; Proactively scans for potential issues before they become crises</li>
<li><strong>Meeting Autopilot</strong> &#8211; Automates meeting preparation, notes processing, and follow-up tracking</li>
<li><strong>Dependency Tracker</strong> &#8211; Maps and monitors cross-team dependencies</li>
<li><strong>Program Dashboard</strong> &#8211; Provides quick terminal dashboards for program health</li>
</ol>
<h2>Key Use Cases</h2>
<p>The TPM Copilot skill is particularly valuable when you need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate status reports or program updates without manual data gathering</li>
<li>Track risks, blockers, or stale tickets across multiple projects</li>
<li>Prepare meeting agendas or extract action items from meeting notes</li>
<li>Map cross-team dependencies and identify critical paths</li>
<li>Create stakeholder dashboards with real-time program health metrics</li>
<li>Monitor sprint health or velocity trends across teams</li>
<li>Write executive summaries that synthesize complex program data</li>
<li>Automate any TPM/PM workflow that involves repetitive data collection and reporting</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technical Architecture</h2>
<p>The TPM Copilot skill is built with a modular architecture that allows it to integrate with various tools through API connections. The core components include:</p>
<h3>Dependencies</h3>
<p>The skill requires Python 3 with the requests library for API interactions. For GitHub functionality, it uses the official GitHub CLI (gh) that must be authenticated. Other dependencies include API connections for Jira, Linear, Slack, and calendar services.</p>
<h3>Workspace Structure</h3>
<p>The skill organizes data in a structured workspace that includes configuration files, program-specific data, templates, meeting notes, and state tracking. This structure allows for easy scaling across multiple programs and teams.</p>
<h3>Configuration Management</h3>
<p>Configuration is handled through JSON files that store API keys, project settings, team configurations, and program-specific parameters. This allows for flexible deployment across different organizational contexts.</p>
<h2>Workflow Automation</h2>
<p>Each workflow in the TPM Copilot skill is designed to solve specific program management challenges:</p>
<h3>Status Report Generation</h3>
<p>The flagship workflow pulls data from Jira/Linear for sprint progress and ticket status, GitHub for PR metrics and CI status, and calendars for upcoming milestones. It generates audience-specific reports in three formats: executive summaries (under 200 words), engineering-focused metrics, and comprehensive program updates. Reports can be delivered via Slack, email, Confluence, or saved as files.</p>
<h3>Risk Detection</h3>
<p>The skill proactively identifies risks including stale tickets (default: no updates in 5 days), blocked tickets, PR review bottlenecks (open >48 hours), sprint scope creep, missed commitments, CI failures, and dependency delays. It maintains a risk register as JSON for tracking and trend analysis.</p>
<h3>Meeting Automation</h3>
<p>Meeting workflows support various meeting types including standups, sprint reviews, executive syncs, and program reviews. The skill generates agendas based on meeting type, processes meeting notes to extract action items, and tracks completion status across meetings.</p>
<h3>Dependency Management</h3>
<p>The dependency tracker maps cross-team dependencies using Jira issue links, labels, and manual entries. It generates dependency tables, highlights critical paths, and alerts when upstream dependencies slip.</p>
<h3>Program Dashboards</h3>
<p>Quick terminal dashboards provide at-a-glance program health with RAG status, sprint progress, open risks, PR review queues, upcoming milestones, and overdue action items.</p>
<h2>Implementation and Setup</h2>
<p>Setting up the TPM Copilot skill involves installing dependencies, authenticating with required tools, configuring API connections in config.json, and initializing the workspace structure. The skill adapts to available connections, so not all integrations are required for basic functionality.</p>
<h3>Program Configuration</h3>
<p>Each program requires configuration that defines workstreams, milestones, stakeholders, and settings. This includes mapping Jira projects to workstreams, defining GitHub repositories, setting up team leads, and establishing program-specific thresholds and timeframes.</p>
<h3>Tracker Selection</h3>
<p>The skill supports both Jira and Linear as primary trackers, with scripts automatically adapting API calls based on the selected tracker. This flexibility allows organizations to use their preferred project management tool.</p>
<h2>Benefits and Impact</h2>
<p>Organizations implementing the TPM Copilot skill report significant time savings and improved program visibility. By automating routine tasks, program managers can focus on strategic initiatives and stakeholder relationships. The proactive risk detection helps prevent issues from escalating, while the standardized reporting ensures consistent communication across the organization.</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To begin using the TPM Copilot skill, organizations should start with a single program to validate the setup and demonstrate value. The skill&#8217;s modular design allows for gradual expansion to additional programs and teams as the organization becomes comfortable with the automation capabilities.</p>
<p>The TPM Copilot skill represents a practical application of AI to program management, addressing real-world challenges that technical program managers face daily. By combining data integration, automation, and intelligent analysis, it transforms how organizations manage complex technical programs.</p>
