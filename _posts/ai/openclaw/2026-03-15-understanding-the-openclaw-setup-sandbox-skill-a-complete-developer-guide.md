<h1>Understanding the OpenClaw setup-sandbox Skill</h1>
<p>In the evolving ecosystem of developer tooling, managing project architecture efficiently is a core challenge. For teams utilizing the OpenClaw framework, the <code>setup-sandbox</code> skill stands out as an essential utility for initializing environments. This article delves into the purpose, mechanics, and implementation of this specific skill to help you streamline your workflow.</p>
<h2>What is the setup-sandbox Skill?</h2>
<p>The <code>setup-sandbox</code> skill is designed to automate the initial file system scaffolding for a new workspace or sandbox. When working with the Recoupable platform, maintaining a standardized directory structure is vital for consistency and ease of navigation. This skill bridges the gap between raw data and a functional development environment by fetching account-specific organization and artist information via the Recoup CLI and mapping it directly onto your local file system.</p>
<h2>Prerequisites and Use Cases</h2>
<p>Before executing this skill, it is crucial to understand when it should be triggered. The <code>setup-sandbox</code> skill is intended for use immediately after a new sandbox has been created. If your current environment is empty and lacks an existing <code>orgs/</code> directory, this is your starting point. However, if the <code>orgs/</code> directory already exists, running this skill is unnecessary and could potentially interfere with your existing setup.</p>
<h3>Environment Configuration</h3>
<p>The skill relies on the <code>RECOUP_ACCOUNT_ID</code> environment variable. Depending on your authentication method, the behavior of the CLI changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Org API Key:</strong> You must explicitly set the <code>RECOUP_ACCOUNT_ID</code> to ensure the CLI fetches data for the correct account.</li>
<li><strong>Personal API Key:</strong> You can omit the <code>--account</code> flag entirely, as the CLI will default to the currently authenticated account context.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Mechanics: How it Works</h2>
<p>The internal logic of the <code>setup-sandbox</code> skill follows a systematic process to ensure that your workspace is structured according to best practices:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Account Verification:</strong> The script first checks if the <code>RECOUP_ACCOUNT_ID</code> variable is present. If it is, all subsequent CLI commands include the flag to isolate the data scope.</li>
<li><strong>Data Acquisition:</strong> It calls <code>recoup orgs list --json</code> to retrieve a comprehensive list of organizations associated with the account.</li>
<li><strong>Artist Mapping:</strong> For every organization identified, the skill performs a subsequent call to <code>recoup artists list --org {organization_id} --json</code>, mapping the artists to their respective organizational containers.</li>
<li><strong>Directory Scaffolding:</strong> The skill executes <code>mkdir -p</code> commands to create a nested hierarchy: <code>orgs/{org}/artists/{artist-slug}</code>. This ensures that every artist has a dedicated, predictable location in the project tree.</li>
<li><strong>Identity Creation (RECOUP.md):</strong> Each artist folder receives a <code>RECOUP.md</code> file. This file serves as the identity marker for the workspace. It tracks the artist&#8217;s name, slug, UUID, and setup status (defaulting to <code>not-setup</code>).</li>
<li><strong>Git Integration:</strong> Finally, the skill automatically performs a <code>git add</code>, <code>commit</code>, and <code>push</code> to ensure that the initial structural state is committed to your version control system.</li>
</ol>
<h2>The Role of RECOUP.md</h2>
<p>The <code>RECOUP.md</code> file is more than just a documentation file; it is the heartbeat of your artist workspace. It acts as an identity bridge between your local repository and the Recoupable platform. By keeping track of the <code>artistId</code> and the <code>status</code>, it enables developers to quickly ascertain the state of the project. When the status is set to <code>not-setup</code>, it acts as a clear signal that the workspace is currently uninitialized and ready for further configuration.</p>
<h2>Post-Setup: Moving to setup-artist</h2>
<p>Once the sandbox has been created by the <code>setup-sandbox</code> skill, the process is not complete. Your next step is to run the <code>setup-artist</code> skill. This is where the actual scaffolding occurs—building out the deeper context files, memory systems, and localized READMEs necessary for development.</p>
<p>You can identify which artists require further attention by running a quick terminal command:</p>
<p><code>grep -rl "status: not-setup" orgs/*/artists/*/RECOUP.md</code></p>
<p>This command will surface every directory that is still pending the <code>setup-artist</code> process. If you find that <code>setup-artist</code> is missing from your environment, you can quickly add it using <code>npx skills add recoupable/setup-artist</code>.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The <code>setup-sandbox</code> skill is a quintessential example of how automation can save developers time and prevent structural drift. By enforcing a strict folder hierarchy and providing a clear mechanism for tracking setup status via <code>RECOUP.md</code>, it ensures that your workspace is always audit-ready and organized. If you are starting a new project within the Recoupable framework, integrating this skill into your initial setup routine is an absolute necessity for long-term scalability and clean code management.</p>
