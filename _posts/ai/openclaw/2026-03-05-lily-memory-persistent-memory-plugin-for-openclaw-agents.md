<p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of AI agents, memory capabilities have become a crucial differentiator between basic chatbots and truly intelligent systems. Lily Memory is a sophisticated persistent memory plugin designed specifically for OpenClaw agents that transforms how AI systems remember, learn, and build upon past interactions. This comprehensive plugin combines the power of traditional keyword search with cutting-edge vector semantic search, creating a hybrid system that ensures your agent never forgets important information while maintaining the ability to recall context from complex conversations.</p>
<p>## What is Lily Memory?</p>
<p>Lily Memory is a persistent memory plugin for OpenClaw agents that provides long-term memory capabilities that survive session resets, compaction, and restarts. Unlike traditional AI systems that treat each conversation as isolated, Lily Memory creates a living knowledge base that grows and evolves with every interaction. The plugin leverages SQLite FTS5 for efficient keyword searching combined with Ollama vector embeddings for semantic understanding, creating a robust hybrid search system that can retrieve information through multiple pathways.</p>
<p>The plugin is designed with zero npm dependencies, relying instead on sqlite3 CLI and native fetch capabilities, making it lightweight and easy to deploy. It works seamlessly with OpenClaw agents and can be configured to operate in various modes depending on your infrastructure and requirements.</p>
<p>## Core Features and Capabilities</p>
<p>### Auto-Recall Functionality</p>
<p>One of Lily Memory&#8217;s most powerful features is its auto-recall capability. Before each LLM turn, the plugin automatically injects relevant memories as context, ensuring the agent has access to pertinent historical information. This creates a more coherent and contextually aware conversation flow, as the agent can reference past discussions, decisions, and facts without requiring manual context injection.</p>
<p>The auto-recall system uses a sophisticated multi-stage process. First, it extracts keywords from the current message, then performs both FTS5 keyword searches and vector similarity searches. The results are merged, deduplicated, and injected as context before the agent generates its response. This ensures that the most relevant memories are always at the agent&#8217;s fingertips.</p>
<p>### Intelligent Auto-Capture</p>
<p>Lily Memory doesn&#8217;t just help with recall—it actively captures and stores information from conversations. The auto-capture feature automatically extracts facts from conversations and stores them in the persistent database. This happens through a pattern recognition system that identifies structured information in the format of entity: key = value.</p>
<p>For example, if a conversation mentions &#8220;config: timeout = 30 seconds&#8221; or &#8220;system: version = 2.1.0&#8221;, Lily Memory will automatically recognize these as structured facts and store them appropriately. This passive capture mechanism ensures that valuable information is never lost and becomes part of the agent&#8217;s growing knowledge base.</p>
<p>### Hybrid Search Architecture</p>
<p>The true power of Lily Memory lies in its hybrid search architecture. The plugin combines two complementary search approaches:</p>
<p>**SQLite FTS5 Keyword Search**: This traditional full-text search provides fast, reliable retrieval of information based on exact keyword matches. It&#8217;s perfect for finding specific facts, dates, names, or other precise information.</p>
<p>**Ollama Vector Semantic Search**: This modern approach uses vector embeddings to understand the semantic meaning of queries. Even if the exact words aren&#8217;t used, the system can find conceptually related information. For instance, searching for &#8220;deadline&#8221; might also return memories about &#8220;due dates&#8221; or &#8220;completion timelines.&#8221;</p>
<p>By combining these approaches, Lily Memory ensures comprehensive coverage of the knowledge base, whether users search with precise terms or more general concepts.</p>
<p>### Stuck Detection and Loop Prevention</p>
<p>One of the more innovative features of Lily Memory is its stuck detection capability. The plugin monitors conversation patterns and can detect when a topic is being repeatedly discussed without progress. It tracks the top 5 content words per response and calculates Jaccard similarity between consecutive messages.</p>
<p>When the system detects that 3 or more consecutive responses have greater than 60% content overlap, it intelligently injects a Reflexion nudge to help break the conversational loop. This prevents the agent from getting stuck in repetitive patterns and encourages more productive dialogue progression.</p>
<p>### Memory Consolidation</p>
<p>Over time, memory systems can become cluttered with redundant or outdated information. Lily Memory addresses this through its memory consolidation feature, which automatically deduplicates entries during startup. This ensures that the knowledge base remains clean, efficient, and relevant, without requiring manual maintenance.</p>
<p>### Dynamic Entity Management</p>
<p>Lily Memory supports dynamic entity management, allowing you to define which types of information should be captured and stored. The system uses a configuration-driven allowlist approach, but also provides runtime tools to add new entities as needed. This flexibility ensures that the memory system can adapt to evolving use cases and information types.</p>
<p>## Technical Architecture</p>
<p>### Database Design</p>
<p>The plugin uses SQLite with FTS5 extension for its storage layer. The database schema is optimized for fast retrieval and efficient storage of both structured facts and vector embeddings. The FTS5 extension provides powerful full-text search capabilities, while the standard SQLite tables handle structured data and relationships.</p>
<p>### Search Flow</p>
<p>The recall process follows a sophisticated multi-step flow:<br />
1. Keyword extraction from the current message<br />
2. FTS5 keyword search across all stored facts<br />
3. Vector similarity search via Ollama (if enabled)<br />
4. Result merging and deduplication<br />
5. Context injection before LLM turn</p>
<p>This ensures that the most relevant and comprehensive information is always available to the agent.</p>
<p>### Capture Flow</p>
<p>The capture process is equally sophisticated:<br />
1. Regex pattern scanning for entity: key = value formats<br />
2. Entity validation against the allowlist<br />
3. Structured storage in SQLite<br />
4. Asynchronous vector embedding via Ollama<br />
5. Integration into the knowledge base</p>
<p>This systematic approach ensures that captured information is both structured and semantically searchable.</p>
<p>## Installation and Configuration</p>
