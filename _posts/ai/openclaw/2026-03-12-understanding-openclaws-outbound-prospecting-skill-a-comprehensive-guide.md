It is meticulously engineered to execute a well-defined workflow aimed at thoroughly researching target companies and drafting personalized outreach emails that are poised to resonate with potential leads.</p>
<h2>Step-by-Step Workflow</h2>
<h3>1. Research and Audit (research_auditor)</h3>
<p>The initial phase of the Outbound Prospecting Skill involves comprehensive research and audit of the target company. This step is pivotal in gathering essential intelligence that will inform subsequent interactions.</p>
<h4>Objective</h4>
<p>The primary objective of the research and audit phase is to collect pertinent information about the target company. This includes understanding their business operations, identifying potential needs, and uncovering personalization points that can be leveraged in the outreach process.</p>
<h4>Actions</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Utilize web_search</strong>: The skill employs web search functionality to locate the company&#8217;s official website, as well as other relevant online resources such as their services, products, and recent news.</li>
<li><strong>Employ web_fetch</strong>: Key pages, including the Homepage, About Us section, and Blog, are fetched to extract detailed textual content. This information is crucial for gaining a comprehensive understanding of the company&#8217;s core offerings and recent developments.</li>
<li><strong>Analyze Fetched Content</strong>: The skill meticulously analyzes the gathered content to identify several key factors:
<ul>
<li>Core Business Offering: Understanding the primary products or services that the company provides.</li>
<li>Target Audience: Identifying the demographic or market segment that the company caters to.</li>
<li>Recent Company Announcements: Highlighting significant events such as product launches, funding rounds, or new hires.</li>
<li>Potential Pain Points: Pinpointing areas where the company may be facing challenges, such as outdated websites, poor SEO, or a lack of recent blog posts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>2. Identify Decision-Maker (contact_finder)</h3>
<p>Once the research and audit phase is complete, the next step is to identify the most relevant person within the company to contact. This step is crucial for ensuring that the outreach efforts are directed towards individuals who have the authority to make decisions.</p>
<h4>Objective</h4>
<p>The primary objective is to pinpoint the decision-maker within the target company who would be most receptive to the outreach efforts.</p>
<h4>Actions</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Leverage web_search</strong>: The skill conducts targeted web searches to locate profiles of key individuals within the company. This may involve searching platforms like LinkedIn using specific queries such as:
<ul>
<li>site:linkedin.com [Company Name] CEO</li>
<li>site:linkedin.com [Company Name] Founder</li>
<li>site:linkedin.com [Company Name] Head of Marketing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Identify Key Personnel</strong>: The skill gathers the names and titles of primary decision-makers, ensuring that the outreach is directed towards the most appropriate individuals.</li>
</ol>
<h3>3. Draft Outreach Email (draft_writer)</h3>
<p>The final phase of the Outbound Prospecting Skill involves crafting a personalized outreach email. This step is where all the gathered information is synthesized to create a compelling message that is tailored to the specific needs and interests of the target company.</p>
<h4>Objective</h4>
<p>The objective is to produce a personalized, evidence-backed email that is ready for human review. The email should strike a balance between a relationship-first approach and a data-driven angle that highlights potential revenue loss or other pertinent insights.</p>
<h4>Actions</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Synthesize Information</strong>: The skill combines all the collected data to form a cohesive narrative that resonates with the target company.</li>
<li><strong>Craft the Email</strong>: The skill drafts an email that adhere to a hybrid tone:
<ul>
<li>A relationship-first opener aimed at establishing a connection and demonstrating genuine interest.</li>
<li>An evidence-backed revenue-loss angle that highlights potential challenges or opportunities based on the research findings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Include Company-Specific Facts</strong>: The email must incorporate at least three company-specific facts discovered during the research phase. This ensures that the message is highly personalized and relevant.</li>
<li><strong>Format for Review</strong>: The final output is a markdown block containing the draft email, ready to be copied and reviewed by a human. It is important to note that the skill does not send the email autonomously; this step is reserved for human intervention.</li>
</ol>
