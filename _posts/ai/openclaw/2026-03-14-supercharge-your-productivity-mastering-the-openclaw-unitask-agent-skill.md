<h1>Introduction to the Unitask Agent for OpenClaw</h1>
<p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of AI-driven productivity, connecting your intelligent agents directly to your action-oriented workflows is the next frontier. The <strong>Unitask Agent skill</strong>, developed for the OpenClaw ecosystem, provides a bridge between your AI and <em>unitask.app</em>, transforming your digital assistant from a conversational tool into an active task manager.</p>
<h2>What is the Unitask Agent Skill?</h2>
<p>The Unitask Agent is an OpenClaw skill designed to help you transition from simply organizing tasks to actually finishing them. Instead of letting your to-do list become a graveyard of intentions, this skill empowers your AI agent to manage your tasks with precision. By connecting your agent to your Unitask account, you enable advanced features like secure task prioritization, automated tagging, efficient time-blocking, and seamless subtask management.</p>
<h2>Core Functionalities and Operations</h2>
<p>This skill isn&#8217;t just a simple interface; it brings a robust set of operations that cover the entire lifecycle of a task. Here is what your AI agent can do once this skill is properly configured:</p>
<h3>Task Lifecycle Management</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create and Retrieve:</strong> The agent can create complex tasks, including nested subtasks using parent IDs, and fetch specific task details instantly.</li>
<li><strong>Updates and Status Tracking:</strong> Beyond just making lists, the agent can perform full mutable updates to task fields or use the specialized <code>update_task_status</code> helper to quickly mark items as done.</li>
<li><strong>Organization and Structure:</strong> Users can leverage the agent to move subtasks between different parents or merge entire parent task trees, helping keep project structures logical as work progresses.</li>
<li><strong>Deletion (with Safeguards):</strong> The skill supports soft-deletion, ensuring you can remove tasks and their descendants without permanently losing data unless intended.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Advanced Tagging and Organization</h3>
<p>The Unitask Agent provides full support for tags. Your AI can list available tags, fetch specific ones, create new ones, update existing tag names or colors, and dynamically add or remove tags from tasks. This allows for highly granular categorization, making it easier to filter your workflow by priority, project, or context.</p>
<h3>Time-Blocking and Scheduling</h3>
<p>One of the most powerful features is the <code>plan_day_timeblocks</code> tool. By passing parameters such as <code>scheduled_start</code> and <code>duration_minutes</code>, the agent can help you visualize your day. You can preview these schedules before applying them, ensuring your calendar reflects your actual capacity rather than just your hopes.</p>
<h2>Security and Scope Model</h2>
<p>Integrations are only as valuable as they are secure. The OpenClaw Unitask Agent implements a sophisticated scope model to ensure the principle of least privilege is always applied:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Read:</strong> Required for viewing tasks and listing information.</li>
<li><strong>Write:</strong> Required for creation, updates, moving, and merging tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Delete:</strong> Required specifically for removal actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The system enforces a safety hierarchy where granting write or delete permissions requires read permissions as a prerequisite. Furthermore, the skill is designed to never require or store full credentials in chat logs, relying instead on <code>UNITASK_API_KEY</code> within a secure environment variable.</p>
<h2>Safety Rules for AI Interactions</h2>
<p>When you enable this skill, your AI follows strict safety protocols:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Confirmation of Destructive Actions:</strong> The agent will always pause and confirm before executing deletions.</li>
<li><strong>Dry Runs for Structural Changes:</strong> Actions like <code>move_subtask</code> and <code>merge_parent_tasks</code> default to a &#8216;dry run&#8217; mode. The agent shows you what the impact will be before executing the changes.</li>
<li><strong>Completion over Deletion:</strong> The agent is encouraged to use <code>status=done</code> to clear your list rather than deleting items, preserving your history and project completion metrics.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Getting Started: Setting Up the Unitask Agent</h2>
<p>If you are looking to integrate this into your workflow, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sign Up:</strong> Ensure you have an active account at <a href="https://unitask.app">unitask.app</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Generate an API Token:</strong> Navigate to your Unitask Dashboard, then go to Settings -> API to create a new token.</li>
<li><strong>Secure Configuration:</strong> Store your token in your agent&#8217;s secret store as <code>UNITASK_API_KEY</code>. Avoid pasting this directly into chat windows.</li>
<li><strong>Initialization:</strong> Once configured, the agent will automatically detect the connection via the hosted MCP endpoint, allowing you to begin issuing natural language commands like &#8220;Plan my morning based on my highest priority tasks&#8221; or &#8220;Move all subtasks related to the website redesign to the Q3 Project folder.&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<h2>Why This Matters for Your Workflow</h2>
<p>Most AI assistants today are essentially chatbots—they can give you advice, but they can&#8217;t help you execute. By using the OpenClaw Unitask Agent, you are evolving your relationship with AI. You are shifting from a passive &#8220;what should I do?&#8221; dynamic to an active &#8220;help me manage this project&#8221; partnership.</p>
<p>Whether it is managing daily chores, handling complex multi-layered subtask structures, or optimizing your time via sophisticated blocking, this tool provides the functional bridge needed to get things done. Embrace the power of an AI that truly understands your tasks and can help you maintain focus throughout the day.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The OpenClaw Unitask Agent is a prime example of how open-source modularity can solve real-world productivity problems. By combining the conversational capabilities of OpenClaw with the structured management of Unitask, users can finally achieve the dream of an AI-driven personal assistant that actually manages their time, not just their queries.</p>
<p>If you are tired of fragmented task management systems, start exploring the Unitask Agent today. It is time to stop just talking about tasks and start finishing them.</p>
