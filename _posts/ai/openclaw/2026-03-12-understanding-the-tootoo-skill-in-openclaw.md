<p>The TooToo skill is a powerful addition to the OpenClaw skill ecosystem that helps users maintain alignment between their AI agent&#8217;s behavior and personal values. This skill acts as a bridge between your TooToo codex and your OpenClaw agent, ensuring that your AI interactions remain consistent with your documented preferences and principles.</p>
<h2>Core Functionality</h2>
<p>At its heart, the TooToo skill serves two primary purposes: syncing your personal codex from TooToo and monitoring alignment. The skill continuously works in the background to ensure that your agent&#8217;s behavior reflects your documented values and preferences. This creates a more personalized and consistent experience across all your AI interactions.</p>
<h2>Key Commands</h2>
<p>The TooToo skill offers several commands to help you manage and monitor your alignment:</p>
<p><strong>/tootoo setup &lt;username&gt;</strong> &#8211; This initial setup command fetches your codex from TooToo and generates a SOUL.md file, which serves as the foundation for your alignment monitoring. This is the first step in establishing the connection between your TooToo account and your OpenClaw agent.</p>
<p><strong>/tootoo sync</strong> &#8211; When you need to force a re-sync of your codex from TooToo, this command comes in handy. It ensures that any updates or changes you&#8217;ve made to your codex are reflected in your agent&#8217;s behavior.</p>
<p><strong>/tootoo report</strong> &#8211; This command generates a comprehensive alignment report for your recent conversations. It provides insights into how well your agent&#8217;s responses align with your documented values and preferences.</p>
<p><strong>/tootoo status</strong> &#8211; For a quick overview of your current alignment statistics, this command displays relevant metrics and information about your agent&#8217;s performance.</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>To get started with the TooToo skill, you&#8217;ll need to configure it with your TooToo username. This is done by adding your username to the openclaw.json file under the skills configuration. The configuration structure looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  "skills": {
    "entries": {
      "tootoo": {
        "username": "your-username"
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Benefits of Using TooToo</h2>
<p>By implementing the TooToo skill, users gain several advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Personalization</strong>: Your agent&#8217;s responses become more tailored to your specific preferences and values.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency</strong>: Across different interactions, your agent maintains a consistent personality and approach.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency</strong>: The alignment reports provide clear insights into how well your agent is adhering to your documented preferences.</li>
<li><strong>Control</strong>: You have the ability to fine-tune and adjust your agent&#8217;s behavior through your TooToo codex.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Integration with OpenClaw</h2>
<p>The TooToo skill is designed to work seamlessly within the OpenClaw ecosystem. It requires the TooToo environment to be installed and properly configured. Once set up, it operates as a user-invocable skill, meaning you can actively engage with it through commands to manage your alignment and codex.</p>
<h2>Version and Maintenance</h2>
<p>Currently at version 1.0.0, the TooToo skill represents a mature implementation of codex syncing and alignment monitoring. The development team continues to refine and improve the skill based on user feedback and evolving needs within the OpenClaw community.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The TooToo skill represents an important step forward in creating more personalized and value-aligned AI interactions. By syncing your codex and providing detailed alignment monitoring, it ensures that your OpenClaw agent remains true to your documented preferences while offering transparency and control over its behavior. Whether you&#8217;re a casual user or a power user, the TooToo skill provides valuable tools for managing your AI experience.</p>
