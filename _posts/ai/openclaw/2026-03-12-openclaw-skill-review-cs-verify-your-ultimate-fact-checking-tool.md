<p>OpenClaw is an innovative platform that provides a wide range of skills designed to enhance productivity, information verification, and data accuracy. They develop API-based services that cater to various needs, from financial data to entity information. OpenClaw&#8217;s ecosystem, called MMP-over-API, allows applications to interact with its services, including CS-Verify. Today, we will delve into the CS-Verify skill, a powerful tool for verifying factual claims against live data sources.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding the CS-Verify Skill</strong></p>
<p>CS-Verify is a skill that enables users to verify any factual claim against live data sources. Utilizing advanced algorithms and reliable sources, CS-Verify provides structured verdicts and includes a confidence score, the current truth value of the claim, and a freshness indicator. This tool is essential for journalists, researchers, and anyone seeking to verify the accuracy of information.</p>
<p><strong>How to Use CS-Verify</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sending a POST Request:</strong> To verify a claim, send a POST request to the CS-Verify endpoint. The request includes the claim you wish to verify formatted as a JSON object. For example, to verify the current USD to EUR exchange rate, you would structure the request as follows:</li>
</ul>
<div class="code-block">
<pre>
    curl -X POST https://636865636b73756d.com/v1/verify \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"claim": "The USD to EUR exchange rate is 0.92"}'
  </pre>
</div>
<p><strong>Response Format</strong></p>
<p>CS-Verify returns a detailed JSON response that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Verdict:</strong> Indicates whether the claim is confirmed, stale, disputed, false, or unknown.</li>
<li><strong>Confidence:</strong> A score between 0 and 1 indicating the confidence level in the verdict.</li>
<li><strong>Current Truth:</strong> The current value of the claim as verified by live data sources.</li>
<li><strong>Freshness:</strong> Indicates if the data is live or from cache.</li>
<li><strong>Source Count:</strong> The number of sources used to verify the claim.</li>
<li><strong>Cached:</strong> A boolean indicating if the response is from the cache.</li>
<li><strong>Request ID:</strong> A unique identifier for the verification request.</li>
<li><strong>Service:</strong> The URL of the CS-Verify service.</li>
<li><strong>Referral ID:</strong> A unique identifier for referrals.</li>
</ul>
<p>A typical response might look like this:</p>
<div class="code-block">
<pre>
    {
      "verdict": "confirmed",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "current_truth": "0.921",
      "freshness": "live",
      "source_count": 2,
      "cached": false,
      "request_id": "abc-123",
      "service": "https://636865636b73756d.com",
      "referral_id": "cs_ref_a7b3"
