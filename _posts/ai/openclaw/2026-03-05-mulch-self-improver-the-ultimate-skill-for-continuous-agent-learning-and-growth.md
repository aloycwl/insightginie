<h2>What is the Mulch Self Improver Skill?</h2>
<p>The Mulch Self Improver skill is a revolutionary approach to making AI agents continuously learn and improve over time. Unlike traditional AI systems that start fresh with each session, this skill enables agents to capture learnings, store expertise, and compound knowledge across multiple interactions. Think of it as giving your AI agents a memory that grows stronger with every project they work on.</p>
<p>At its core, the Mulch Self Improver skill leverages a passive layer called Mulch that doesn&#8217;t contain an LLM itself but works alongside your agents. Agents use Mulch to write learnings and read from accumulated expertise, creating a powerful system where knowledge compounds across sessions, domains, and even teammates.</p>
<h2>How Does Mulch Self Improvement Work?</h2>
<p>The mechanics behind this skill are elegantly simple yet incredibly powerful. When an agent encounters something valuable—whether it&#8217;s a failure, a correction, or a new best practice—it can record that learning using the Mulch CLI. These learnings are stored in a dedicated <code>.mulch/</code> directory as append-only JSONL files that are git-tracked and queryable.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the typical workflow:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Session Start:</strong> Run <code>mulch prime</code> to load existing expertise into the agent&#8217;s context</li>
<li><strong>During Work:</strong> When issues arise or new insights emerge, use <code>mulch record</code> to capture learnings</li>
<li><strong>Before Finishing:</strong> Review and record any remaining insights</li>
<li><strong>Promotion:</strong> Move proven patterns to project memory files like CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md</li>
</ol>
<p>The skill includes intelligent auto-detection that can identify learning moments automatically. When commands fail, users correct the agent, or retries are requested, the system prompts to record these experiences for future sessions.</p>
<h2>Key Features and Benefits</h2>
<h3>Better and More Consistent Coding</h3>
<p>By capturing proven patterns and conventions, agents develop more consistent coding practices. When an agent learns that a particular approach works better or that certain conventions should be followed, that knowledge becomes part of the collective memory and is applied consistently across all future sessions.</p>
<h3>Improved User Experience</h3>
<p>Agents become more reliable and accurate over time. Instead of repeatedly making the same mistakes or asking the same questions, they learn from past interactions. This creates a smoother, more professional experience for users who benefit from an agent that seems to &#8220;remember&#8221; important details about their projects and preferences.</p>
<h3>Reduced Hallucination</h3>
<p>One of the most significant benefits is grounding agents in project-specific expertise. Rather than relying solely on general knowledge, agents can reference documented learnings about specific tools, APIs, or project conventions. This dramatically reduces the likelihood of agents making things up or providing incorrect information based on outdated knowledge.</p>
<h3>Token Efficiency</h3>
<p>Benchmarks show approximately 54% fewer characters needed to achieve the same resolutions. By having agents start with relevant context already loaded, less back-and-forth is required to get to the right solution. This translates to faster problem-solving and more efficient use of computational resources.</p>
<h2>Common Use Cases</h2>
<h3>Command or Tool Failures</h3>
<p>When a command fails or an API returns an error, agents can record what went wrong and how to fix it. For example, if a database migration fails due to a specific constraint, that failure and its resolution become part of the collective knowledge, preventing similar issues in future projects.</p>
<h3>User Corrections</h3>
<p>When users correct agents—saying things like &#8220;No, that&#8217;s not right&#8221; or &#8220;Actually, it works differently&#8221;—these corrections are valuable learning opportunities. The skill captures these moments, ensuring the agent doesn&#8217;t make the same mistake again.</p>
<h3>Missing Features or Capabilities</h3>
<p>When users request features that don&#8217;t exist, agents can record these as decisions or feature requests. This creates a running log of desired capabilities that can inform future development or help other agents understand project requirements better.</p>
<h3>Knowledge Updates</h3>
<p>Technology evolves rapidly, and what was true yesterday might be outdated today. When agents discover their knowledge was wrong or outdated, they can update the collective memory, ensuring all future sessions benefit from the most current information.</p>
<h3>Better Approaches and Best Practices</h3>
<p>When agents find more efficient solutions or discover best practices, these can be recorded as conventions or guides. This ensures that successful strategies are shared across all agents and sessions, continuously raising the bar for performance.</p>
<h2>Getting Started with Mulch Self Improver</h2>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>The skill can be used without installation by leveraging npx, but for frequent use, installation is recommended:</p>
<pre><code>npm install -g mulch-cli
</code></pre>
<h3>Project Setup</h3>
<p>Initialize Mulch in your project:</p>
<pre><code>mulch init
</code></pre>
<p>Then add relevant domains. The skill includes 24 preset domains covering areas like API, database, testing, frontend, backend, and more. You can add all preset domains at once or select specific ones that match your project areas.</p>
<h3>Provider Hooks</h3>
<p>For seamless integration with various AI providers, setup hooks are available:</p>
<pre><code>mulch setup cursor
mulch setup claude
mulch setup codex
mulch setup gemini
</code></pre>
<p>These hooks remind agents to record learnings at appropriate moments, making the process more automatic and less reliant on manual intervention.</p>
<h2>Record Types and When to Use Them</h2>
<h3>Failure Records</h3>
<p>Use when something goes wrong and you discover how to fix it. Requires a description of what happened and the resolution that solved the problem. This is perfect for capturing error messages, debugging steps, and workarounds.</p>
<h3>Convention Records</h3>
<p>Use for short rules and best practices like &#8220;Always use WAL mode for SQLite&#8221; or &#8220;Use pnpm not npm for this project.&#8221; These are the quick tips and conventions that make development smoother.</p>
<h3>Pattern Records</h3>
<p>Use for named patterns that you want to apply consistently. These can include architectural patterns, coding patterns, or workflow patterns that have proven valuable.</p>
<h3>Decision Records</h3>
<p>Use for architectural choices, technology decisions, or feature tracking. When you decide to use a particular framework or implement a specific feature, recording the rationale helps future agents understand the context behind these choices.</p>
<h3>Reference Records</h3>
<p>Use for key files, endpoints, or resources that are important to remember. This could include API endpoints, configuration file locations, or critical documentation links.</p>
<h3>Guide Records</h3>
<p>Use for step-by-step procedures that are valuable to document. These are more detailed than conventions and provide comprehensive instructions for specific tasks.</p>
<h2>Multi-Agent Safety and Collaboration</h2>
<p>The Mulch Self Improver skill is designed with collaboration in mind. It uses advisory file locking and atomic writes to ensure that multiple agents can work safely in parallel. The JSONL format with <code>merge=union</code> in <code>.gitattributes</code> ensures that concurrent writes are handled gracefully.</p>
<p>This means teams can have multiple agents working on different aspects of a project, all contributing to and benefiting from the same pool of knowledge. The system is thread-safe and designed to handle the complexities of collaborative AI work.</p>
<h2>Promoting Learnings to Project Memory</h2>
<p>Not all learnings should stay in the Mulch store. When patterns prove valuable and broadly applicable, they should be promoted to project memory files:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CLAUDE.md:</strong> Project-specific facts, conventions, and guidelines</li>
<li><strong>AGENTS.md:</strong> Workflow improvements and agent instructions</li>
<li><strong>SOUL.md:</strong> Behavioral patterns and cultural conventions</li>
<li><strong>TOOLS.md:</strong> Tool-specific gotchas and best practices</li>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The skill includes a <code>mulch onboard</code> command that generates snippets for these files, making promotion easy and standardized.</p>
<h2>Best Practices for Maximum Benefit</h2>
<h3>Record Immediately</h3>
<p>The context is freshest right after an issue occurs. Recording learnings immediately ensures that details aren&#8217;t forgotten and that the resolution is accurately captured.</p>
<h3>Use Domains Consistently</h3>
<p>Stick to the same domains for related learnings. If you&#8217;re recording API-related learnings, always use the <code>api</code> domain. This makes searching and organizing knowledge much more effective.</p>
<h3>Link Related Records</h3>
<p>Use the <code>--relates-to</code> flag to connect related learnings. This creates a network of related knowledge that&#8217;s more valuable than isolated facts.</p>
<h3>Run Prime at Session Start</h3>
<p>Always start sessions with <code>mulch prime</code> to load existing expertise. This ensures agents begin with the most relevant context for the current project.</p>
<h3>Promote When Proven</h3>
<p>Don&#8217;t leave valuable patterns in the Mulch store forever. When something proves consistently useful, promote it to the appropriate project memory file so all agents can benefit.</p>
<h2>Integration with OpenClaw and Other Systems</h2>
<p>The Mulch Self Improver skill integrates seamlessly with OpenClaw&#8217;s workspace structure. SOUL.md, AGENTS.md, TOOLS.md, and other project memory files live in the appropriate directories, creating a cohesive system for agent knowledge management.</p>
<p>For teams using other AI providers or custom setups, the skill provides generic setup instructions that work with any agent system. The core principle remains the same: capture learnings, store them systematically, and make them available for future use.</p>
<h2>The Future of AI Agent Learning</h2>
<p>The Mulch Self Improver skill represents a significant step forward in how we think about AI agent capabilities. Rather than viewing agents as static tools that perform the same way every time, this approach embraces continuous learning and improvement.</p>
<p>As AI agents become more prevalent in software development and other fields, skills like this will be essential for maximizing their value. The ability to learn from experience, share knowledge across agents, and continuously improve performance will separate truly useful AI systems from those that remain limited and repetitive.</p>
<p>By implementing the Mulch Self Improver skill, teams can create AI agents that get better over time, adapt to their specific needs, and provide increasingly valuable assistance. It&#8217;s not just about making agents smarter—it&#8217;s about making them wiser through experience and collaboration.</p>
