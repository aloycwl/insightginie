<h1>Mastering Your Living Room Air Quality with OpenClaw&#8217;s Automated Monitor</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/openclaw/skills/tree/main/skills/skills/maverick-2/living-room-air-monitor">Living Room Air Monitor</a> from OpenClaw is a powerful skill designed to transform how you track and understand your indoor air quality. This comprehensive tool provides detailed, automated monitoring of four key environmental metrics that significantly impact your comfort and health.</p>
<p>Modern smart homes offer more than just convenience— they provide valuable insights into our living environments. OpenClaw&#8217;s air quality monitor skill takes this a step further by automating the collection, analysis, and reporting of essential air quality data. By connecting to IKEA&#8217;s Dirigera ecosystem, this skill creates a seamless air quality monitoring system that integrates perfectly with your existing smart home setup.</p>
<h2>Understanding the Four Key Metrics</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>Temperature</h3>
<p>While one of the most familiar environmental metrics, accurate temperature tracking provides valuable insights into your home&#8217;s thermal efficiency. The skill records temperature data alongside other metrics, enabling you to identify correlations between temperature and other air quality factors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Humidity</h3>
<p>Relative humidity plays a crucial role in comfort and health. The Living Room Air Monitor tracks this metric hourly, allowing you to maintain ideal humidity levels (typically between 30-50%) and prevent issues like mold growth or excessively dry air that can irritate respiratory systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>PM2.5 (Particulate Matter)</h3>
<p>These fine particles (less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter) pose significant health risks when present in high concentrations. The monitor tracks PM2.5 levels with &#8216;Good&#8217; (≤12 µg/m³), &#8216;Moderate&#8217; (12.1-35 µg/m³), and &#8216;Unhealthy&#8217; (35+ µg/m³) classifications to help you make informed decisions about ventilation and air purification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>CO2 (Carbon Dioxide)</h3>
<p>Elevated CO2 levels often indicate poor ventilation and can lead to drowsiness and decreased cognitive function. The skill measures CO2 concentrations with &#8216;Good&#8217; (≤1000 ppm), &#8216;Moderate&#8217; (1001-2000 ppm), and &#8216;Poor&#8217; (2000+ ppm) classifications to alert you when it&#8217;s time to improve air circulation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Automated Data Collection and Storage</h2>
<p>One of the standout features of this skill is its ability to automatically collect data every hour. The skill establishes a consistent data collection routine through a cron job, ensuring comprehensive coverage without any manual intervention. This regular collection creates a robust dataset that reveals patterns and trends over time.</p>
<p>All collected data resides in an SQLite database stored in <code>~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/living-room-air-monitor/data/air_quality.db</code> with a schema that includes datetime, temperature, humidity, PM2.5, and CO2 fields. The skill intelligently handles incomplete readings by only saving data when all sensor values are present, ensuring data quality and reliability.</p>
<h2>Comprehensive Querying Capabilities</h2>
<p>With the <code>query_data.py</code> script, you can retrieve data in multiple ways to answer specific questions about your living room&#8217;s air quality:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Single readings</strong> by exact datetime or interval</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Daily breakdowns</strong> of all readings for a specific day</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monthly summaries</strong> to analyze seasonal patterns</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Average calculations</strong> for any metric by day or month</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access to the <strong>complete date range</strong> of available data</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, to determine if a particular day had healthy air quality, you could query all readings for that day and examine any periods where PM2.5 or CO2 levels exceeded recommended thresholds. Conversely, if you&#8217;re curious about the average temperature during a particularly hot month, you can quickly retrieve that specific data point.</p>
<h2>Visualizing Your Air Quality Data</h2>
<p>The <code>generate_chart.py</code> script transforms raw data into easy-to-understand visualizations. You can generate line charts for various time periods, enabling you to identify trends and patterns at a glance:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Daily charts</strong> to analyze hourly variations on a specific day</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Weekly charts</strong> to observe patterns over a longer period</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monthly, 3-month, 6-month, and yearly charts</strong> to study seasonal trends</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These visualizations are particularly helpful for identifying daily patterns (such as concentration of pollutants during cooking or temperature fluctuations from thermostat adjustments), weekly trends (like increased CO2 levels on weekends when the home is more occupied), or seasonal variations in humidity and air quality.</p>
<h2>Automated Reporting via Email and WhatsApp</h2>
<p>Sharing insights becomes effortless with the skill&#8217;s <code>send_report.py</code> functionality. The comprehensive reports include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The period covered and total number of readings</li>
<li>Average values for all metrics with ranges</li>
<li>Air quality assessments for PM2.5 and CO2</li>
<li>All individual readings with timestamps</li>
</ul>
<p>These reports can be automatically sent through your preferred communication channel— either via email using the configured <code>gog</code> CLI or through WhatsApp using the <code>wacli</code> tool. You can schedule regular reports (daily, weekly, or monthly) to stay informed about your living room&#8217;s air quality without actively seeking out the information.</p>
<h2>Seamless Integration with Your Smart Home</h2>
<p>Incorporating the Living Room Air Monitor into your workflow is straightforward. Once the necessary dependencies are installed and the Dirigera hub is properly configured with a valid auth token, the skill integrates seamlessly with your existing Smart Home Assistant.</p>
<p>The <code>.dirigera_token</code> file at <code>~/.openclaw/workspace/.dirigera_token</code> stores the authentication necessary to access and retrieve data from your IKEA Dirigera hub at IP address 192.168.1.100. This integration ensures consistent, reliable data collection that forms the foundation for all the skill&#8217;s reporting and monitoring capabilities.</p>
<p>With CONTACTS.json properly configured in your workspace root, the automated reporting features can send insights directly to your preferred communication channels. This configuration typically includes your name, email address, and WhatsApp number in international format for seamless communication.</p>
<h2>Enhancing Your Home&#8217;s Air Quality with Insights</h2>
<p>The Living Room Air Monitor skill represents a significant step forward in integrating environmental awareness into smart home ecosystems. By providing automated, comprehensive monitoring of key air quality metrics, this tool gives you the information needed to make informed decisions about your living environment.</p>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re concerned about maintaining proper ventilation, want to monitor how household activities impact air quality, or simply enjoy having detailed environmental data at your fingertips, this skill offers a complete solution. The combination of automated data collection, flexible querying capabilities, insightful visualizations, and convenient reporting options makes the Living Room Air Monitor an invaluable addition to any smart home.</p>
<p>As with any home monitoring system, the true value lies not just in the data collection but in how you use those insights to improve your environment. With OpenClaw&#8217;s Living Room Air Monitor, you have a complete toolkit to understand your air quality and take action to create a healthier, more comfortable living space.</p>
