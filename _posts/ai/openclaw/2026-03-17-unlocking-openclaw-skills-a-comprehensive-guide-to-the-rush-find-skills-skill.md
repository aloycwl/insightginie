<h2>Introduction to OpenClaw and Rush-Find-Skills</h2>
<p>OpenClaw is an open-source initiative focused on enhancing the capabilities of AI agents through modular skills. One of its key components is the <code>rush-find-skills</code> skill, which simplifies the process of discovering and installing skills for users.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>The Purpose of the Rush-Find-Skills Skill</h2>
<p>The primary objective of the <code>rush-find-skills</code> skill is to assist users in finding and installing AI agent skills when they express interest in extending capabilities or need help with specific tasks. This skill leverages <code>reskill</code>, a Git-based package manager for AI agent skills, to provide a seamless experience.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Understanding Reskill</h2>
<p><code>reskill</code> is a package manager designed specifically for AI agent skills. It offers features like declarative configuration, version locking, and synchronization for managing skills across various projects and teams. The Rush-Find-Skills skill utilizes <code>reskill</code> to search for, present, and install skills from the Rush community registry.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Key Commands for Skill Discovery</h2>
<p>The following <code>reskill</code> commands are essential for skill discovery and management:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>reskill find &lt;query&gt;</code>: Search for skills by keyword.</li>
<li><code>reskill find &lt;query&gt; --json</code>: Search with machine-readable JSON output.</li>
<li><code>reskill install &lt;ref&gt;</code>: Install a skill.</li>
<li><code>reskill list</code>: List installed skills.</li>
<li><code>reskill info &lt;skill&gt;</code>: Show skill details.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h2>How the Rush-Find-Skills Skill Helps Users</h2>
<p>The skill follows a &quot;Search → Present → Ask → Install&quot; approach to ensure users are aware of the available options and can make informed decisions.</p>
<h3>Step 0: Resolve CLI and Registry</h3>
<p>Before searching for skills, the skill checks for the availability of <code>reskill</code> and determines the registry to use. The registry priority is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>--registry &lt;url&gt;</code> CLI option</li>
<li><code>RESKILL_REGISTRY</code> environment variable</li>
<li><code>defaults.publishRegistry</code> in <code>skills.json</code></li>
<li>Default: <a href="https://rush.zhenguanyu.com/">https://rush.zhenguanyu.com/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If <code>reskill</code> is not installed, the skill falls back to <code>npx reskill@latest</code>.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Understanding User Needs</h2>
<p>The skill identifies the user&#8217;s domain, specific task, and whether the task is common enough that a skill likely exists. For example, if a user asks, &quot;How do I make my React app faster?&quot; the skill understands the need for React performance optimization.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Searching for Skills</h2>
<p>The skill employs a progressive search strategy to maximize results. It starts with the natural query, then tries hyphenated versions, single keywords, and finally synonyms or related terms. The skill filters results based on relevance to the user&#8217;s original request.</p>
<h3>Example Flow</h3>
<p>If a user asks for help with &quot;frontend design,&quot; the skill might follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find &quot;frontend design&quot; → 0 results</li>
<li>Find &quot;frontend-design&quot; → 0 results</li>
<li>Find &quot;frontend&quot; → 3 results</li>
<li>Read descriptions → filter → 1 relevant result</li>
<li>Present the relevant result to the user</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Presenting Results and Installing Skills</h2>
<p>Once relevant skills are found, the skill presents them clearly, including the skill name, description, version, author, registry, and install command. The skill then asks for user confirmation before proceeding with the installation.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I found a skill that might help! (from registry: rush.zhenguanyu.com)</p>
<p><strong>@scope/react-best-practices</strong> (v1.2.0)</p>
<p>React and performance optimization guidelines.</p>
<p>To install: <code>reskill install @scope/react-best-practices -y --registry https://rush.zhenguanyu.com</code></p>
<p>Would you like me to install it?</p>
</blockquote>
</section>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Rush-Find-Skills skill is an invaluable tool for users looking to extend the capabilities of their AI agents. By leveraging <code>reskill</code> and following a structured approach, the skill simplifies the process of discovering and installing relevant skills, ensuring users can efficiently tackle their tasks.</p>
