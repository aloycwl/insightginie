<h2>What is the Deterministic Controller for OpenClaw?</h2>
<p>The Deterministic Controller for OpenClaw is a documentation-only skill that provides templates and guidance for implementing a repeatable, evidence-gated orchestration loop. Unlike traditional controllers that automatically modify configurations or create cron jobs, this skill focuses on providing the foundational templates and documentation needed to build a robust OpenClaw implementation.</p>
<h2>Key Features and Philosophy</h2>
<p>The deterministic controller follows a specific philosophy centered around predictability and evidence-based operations. Here are the core principles:</p>
<h3>When to Use This Skill</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deterministic Orchestration</strong>: When you need a repeatable orchestration loop that combines heartbeat monitoring, cron polling, and subagent coordination</li>
<li><strong>Evidence-Gated Completion</strong>: When you want to ensure tasks only complete when proper artifacts are available, preventing false DONE states</li>
<li><strong>Lean Portfolio Management</strong>: When you want a streamlined ACTIVITIES.md approach with external sprint planning via Plan Path</li>
</ul>
<h3>When Not to Use This Skill</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Turnkey Installation</strong>: This skill does not automatically patch configurations or create cron jobs</li>
<li><strong>Complex Runtime Logic</strong>: This skill provides templates and documentation only, not executable code</li>
</ul>
<h2>Outputs and Templates</h2>
<p>The skill provides several key template files that serve as the foundation for your OpenClaw implementation:</p>
<h3>Core Template Files</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>templates/HEARTBEAT.md</strong>: The heartbeat monitoring template that tracks system health and status</li>
<li><strong>templates/ACTIVITIES.md</strong>: The activities template that manages your lean portfolio queue</li>
<li><strong>templates/SPRINT_TEMPLATE.md</strong>: The sprint template for structured project planning</li>
</ul>
<h3>Supporting Documentation</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>examples/setup_prompt.md</strong>: Copy/paste prompts for initial setup</li>
<li><strong>examples/project_to_sprint_prompt.md</strong>: Prompts for converting projects to sprint format</li>
<li><strong>docs/poll_cron_payload.txt</strong>: The cron payload text for scheduled operations</li>
<li><strong>docs/openclaw_config_snippets.md</strong>: Configuration guidance and code snippets</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Use the Deterministic Controller</h2>
<p>Implementing the deterministic controller requires a methodical approach:</p>
<h3>Step 1: Start with the Repository README</h3>
<p>Begin by thoroughly reading the main README.md file in the repository. This provides the foundational understanding of how the skill works and its overall architecture.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Copy Templates to Your Workspace</h3>
<p>Copy the template files from the skill folder into your working directory. These templates serve as the starting point for your OpenClaw implementation.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Configure Your Environment</h3>
<p>Set up your environment by configuring key parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TELEGRAM_GROUP_ID</strong>: Set this in HEARTBEAT.md to specify your notification channel</li>
<li><strong>Heartbeat Prompt and Cadence</strong>: Configure the heartbeat monitoring frequency and prompts in openclaw.json</li>
<li><strong>Configuration Snippets</strong>: Refer to docs/openclaw_config_snippets.md for detailed configuration guidance</li>
</ul>
<h2>Understanding the Architecture</h2>
<p>The deterministic controller is built around three core components that work together to create a cohesive orchestration system:</p>
<h3>Heartbeat Monitoring</h3>
<p>The heartbeat component provides continuous monitoring of system health and status. It uses the HEARTBEAT.md template to track the operational state of your OpenClaw implementation, ensuring that all components are functioning correctly.</p>
<h3>Activity Management</h3>
<p>The activities component, defined in ACTIVITIES.md, manages your portfolio queue using a lean approach. This template focuses on external sprint planning via Plan Path, providing a streamlined way to manage project activities without internal complexity.</p>
<h3>Sprint Planning</h3>
<p>The sprint template (SPRINT_TEMPLATE.md) provides structured planning capabilities for your projects. This template helps organize work into manageable sprints with clear objectives and deliverables.</p>
<h2>Evidence-Gated Completion</h2>
<p>One of the most important features of the deterministic controller is its evidence-gated completion approach. This means that tasks and operations only mark themselves as complete when specific artifacts or evidence are available. This prevents false positives and ensures that work is truly finished before moving on to the next phase.</p>
<h2>Cron Polling Integration</h2>
<p>The controller integrates with cron polling through the docs/poll_cron_payload.txt file. This allows for scheduled operations that work in conjunction with the heartbeat monitoring to create a comprehensive orchestration system.</p>
<h2>Configuration and Customization</h2>
<p>While the skill provides templates, it’s designed to be customized for your specific needs. The docs/openclaw_config_snippets.md file provides detailed guidance on how to configure various aspects of your implementation, from basic setup to advanced customization options.</p>
<h2>Best Practices</h2>
<p>When implementing the deterministic controller, consider these best practices:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Start Simple</strong>: Begin with the basic templates and gradually add complexity as needed</li>
<li><strong>Test Thoroughly</strong>: Verify that your heartbeat monitoring and activity management are working correctly before adding more components</li>
<li><strong>Document Changes</strong>: Keep track of any customizations or modifications you make to the templates</li>
<li><strong>Regular Review</strong>: Periodically review your configuration to ensure it still meets your needs</li>
</ol>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Deterministic Controller for OpenClaw provides a solid foundation for building a repeatable, evidence-based orchestration system. By focusing on templates and documentation rather than automatic configuration changes, it gives you the control and predictability needed for complex operations. Whether you’re managing a lean portfolio or coordinating multiple subagents, this skill provides the tools and guidance to create a robust OpenClaw implementation.</p>
