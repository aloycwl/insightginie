<h1>Mastering the Upbit Market Data Skill for OpenClaw</h1>
<p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of algorithmic trading and automated financial agents, the ability to fetch reliable market data is paramount. The OpenClaw framework offers a robust solution for developers looking to bridge the gap between AI agents and real-time cryptocurrency data. Specifically, the <strong>Upbit Market Data Skill</strong> serves as a critical utility for those working with the Upbit exchange. In this comprehensive guide, we will explore what this skill does, how to set it up, and the importance of using its strict mode.</p>
<h2>What is the Upbit Market Data Skill?</h2>
<p>The Upbit Market Data Skill is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to integrate seamlessly into the OpenClaw ecosystem. Its primary function is to act as a bridge between the OpenClaw agent and the Upbit Open API. By utilizing this skill, developers can automate the retrieval of market information, ranging from simple price tickers to complex orderbook analysis and historical candle data.</p>
<p>This skill is built using Node.js, ensuring that it is lightweight and performant. Because it outputs data in a standard JSON format, it is exceptionally well-suited for integration with LLM (Large Language Model) agents, which expect structured data to perform logic, analysis, or decision-making tasks.</p>
<h2>Core Capabilities</h2>
<p>The skill is designed to handle a wide variety of requests, effectively mirroring the capabilities of the native Upbit API but through a cleaner, agent-friendly CLI grammar. Key features include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trading Pair Discovery:</strong> Easily list available markets supported by the exchange.</li>
<li><strong>Candlestick Analysis:</strong> Retrieve historical price data across various timeframes, including seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and even years.</li>
<li><strong>Recent Trades:</strong> Fetch the latest execution logs to analyze market liquidity and volume.</li>
<li><strong>Ticker Retrieval:</strong> Get real-time price updates for specific trading pairs or by quote currency.</li>
<li><strong>Orderbook Depth:</strong> Access current buy and sell orders to perform market impact or sentiment analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Watchlist Management:</strong> Automatically track pre-defined assets via a configuration file.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Installation and Configuration</h2>
<p>Getting started with the Upbit Market Data Skill is straightforward. As it relies on Node.js (version 18+), ensure that you have a recent environment set up on your machine. After cloning the repository, simply run <code>npm install</code> to download the necessary dependencies.</p>
<p>The skill requires a configuration file located at <code>config/config.json</code>. This file is where you store your API keys and your desired watchlist of trading pairs. A typical configuration looks like this:</p>
<pre>{ "upbit": { "baseUrl": "https://api.upbit.com", "accessKey": "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY", "secretKey": "YOUR_SECRET_KEY" }, "watchlist": [ "KRW-BTC", "KRW-ETH", "KRW-SOL" ] }</pre>
<p>The flexibility of the tool allows you to override this configuration path at runtime, making it ideal for CI/CD pipelines or environments where multiple bot configurations are required.</p>
<h2>The Power of Strict Mode</h2>
<p>One of the most important aspects of this skill is the <strong>Strict Mode</strong>. When working with LLM agents, there is always a risk that the model might generate non-deterministic or ambiguous CLI commands. Since OpenClaw agents might reorder arguments, the strict mode was created to enforce a canonical command shape.</p>
<p>By appending <code>--strict=true</code> to your commands, you instruct the skill to validate inputs more aggressively. In strict mode, the command structure is immutable. For example, when requesting candle data, the candle type (e.g., minutes, days) must immediately follow the <code>candles</code> keyword. This eliminates confusion and ensures that the API returns the exact data the agent expects.</p>
<p>Why does this matter? For high-frequency data operations or automated trading systems, an ambiguous command could lead to a silent failure or, worse, an incorrect data request. Strict mode guarantees that your command is always interpreted exactly as intended, providing a robust layer of reliability to your automated workflows.</p>
<h2>Advanced Usage: From Tickers to Candles</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at some practical command examples to demonstrate the versatility of the tool. To fetch the current market prices for a specific list of assets, you might use: <code>node skill.js tickers --markets=KRW-BTC,KRW-ETH --strict=true</code>. This returns a JSON response containing all the market stats you need.</p>
<p>If you are building a technical analysis agent, you will frequently use the <code>candles</code> command. The syntax is specific: you specify the timeframe unit immediately. For instance, to get 5-minute candles for Ethereum, the command is <code>node skill.js candles minutes --market=KRW-ETH --unit=5 --count=100 --strict=true</code>. The skill supports a range of units (1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 240), providing the flexibility needed for various trading strategies.</p>
<h2>Handling Errors and Rate Limits</h2>
<p>In the world of cryptocurrency APIs, rate limiting is a common hurdle. Upbit enforces specific limits to ensure service stability. The Upbit Market Data Skill is built to propagate these error responses back to the OpenClaw agent. Whether you encounter a 429 (Too Many Requests), a 418 (Request Blocked), or a 400 (Bad Request), the skill returns the Upbit error payload in the <code>error.upbit</code> field of the JSON output. This allows your agent to handle the error intelligently, perhaps by implementing a wait strategy or switching to a different data source.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Upbit Market Data Skill is an indispensable tool for anyone utilizing OpenClaw to interact with crypto markets. By standardizing the way data is fetched and providing strict validation, it lowers the barrier to entry for developers looking to build sophisticated, AI-driven financial agents. Whether you are performing simple price monitoring or building a complex, time-series-based trading strategy, this skill provides the structure, speed, and reliability required to succeed in the fast-paced crypto environment.</p>
