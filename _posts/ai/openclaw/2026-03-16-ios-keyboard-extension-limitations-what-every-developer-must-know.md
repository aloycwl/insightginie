<h2>Understanding iOS Keyboard Extension Limitations</h2>
<p>When developing iOS custom keyboards with voice or audio features, developers face significant technical constraints that can make or break their applications. This comprehensive guide explores the hard limitations discovered through real-world projects like PolyVoice and provides actionable workarounds.</p>
<h3>Hard Limitations You Cannot Work Around</h3>
<h4>1. Microphone Access Is Completely Blocked</h4>
<p>Keyboard extensions cannot access the microphone under any circumstances. Attempts to use <code>AVAudioRecorder</code> will fail with permission errors, and <code>SFSpeechRecognizer</code> is entirely unavailable. This restriction exists because Apple’s security model prevents keyboards from potentially keylogging audio data.</p>
<p>Why this matters: If your keyboard requires voice dictation, real-time audio processing, or Siri integration, you’re fundamentally blocked from implementing these features within the keyboard extension itself.</p>
<h4>2. Opening Other Apps Is Prohibited</h4>
<p>Keyboard extensions cannot programmatically launch the main application or any other app. Calls to <code>UIApplication.shared.open()</code> return false, URL schemes like <code>myapp://</code> don’t work, and <code>ExtensionContext.open()</code> is unavailable.</p>
<p>Why this exists: Apple prevents malicious keyboards from launching apps without explicit user consent, protecting users from potential security threats.</p>
<h4>3. Strict Memory Limitations</h4>
<p>Keyboard extensions operate under severe memory constraints of approximately 30-60MB. Exceeding this limit causes the app to terminate silently without crash logs—it simply disappears.</p>
<p>Audio processing is particularly problematic, as heavy processing can trigger immediate termination. Developers must implement aggressive optimization strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Record at 16kHz mono instead of 44.1kHz</li>
<li>Limit bitrate to 32kbps maximum</li>
<li>Implement immediate file cleanup after processing</li>
<li>Enforce a 60-second maximum recording limit</li>
</ul>
<h4>4. No Persistent Storage Available</h4>
<p>Standard <code>UserDefaults</code> doesn’t persist within keyboard extensions. Developers must use <code>UserDefaults(suiteName: "group.com.company.app")</code> with App Groups capability enabled in both targets.</p>
<h4>5. Network Access Requires Full Permissions</h4>
<p>API calls fail unless users explicitly enable “Allow Full Access” in Settings. This setting is buried deep in Settings > General > Keyboard > [Keyboard Name], and most users won’t navigate to enable it. Additionally, you cannot prompt users effectively from within the keyboard UI.</p>
<h3>Partial Workarounds With User Friction</h3>
<h4>The Manual Switch Pattern</h4>
<p>The only viable workaround involves significant user friction:</p>
<ol>
<li>User taps a button in the keyboard</li>
<li>Keyboard shows alert: “Open [App Name] to record?”</li>
<li>User manually switches to main app (Home button, swipe, etc.)</li>
<li>Main app detects active session via App Groups</li>
<li>Main app auto-records on appear, auto-stops on silence (2 seconds)</li>
<li>Auto-copies result to clipboard</li>
<li>User manually switches back to target app</li>
<li>Keyboard auto-pastes on reappear</li>
</ol>
<p>This flow creates multiple friction points: two manual app switches, context switching that breaks workflow, users forgetting to return, and clipboard data being potentially overwritten.</p>
<h3>Alternative Architectures to Consider</h3>
<h4>Option 1: Share Extension</h4>
<p>Using a Share Sheet instead of a keyboard extension provides full app capabilities, including audio recording and processing. However, it’s not a true keyboard—users must open the share sheet for each text field, adding an extra step to their workflow.</p>
<h4>Option 2: Full App Mode</h4>
<p>Abandon the keyboard extension entirely and use only the main app. Users open the app, record dictation, copy the result, switch to the target app, and paste manually. This approach offers no memory limits, full microphone access, and reliable operation.</p>
<h4>Option 3: Siri Shortcuts Integration</h4>
<p>Provide Siri Shortcuts for voice-to-text functionality. Users can say “Hey Siri, dictate with [App Name]” and receive text returned to the current app. This is fully supported by Apple but requires Siri setup and isn’t instant.</p>

<h3>Final Recommendation</h3>
<p>For voice dictation or AI transcription features, avoid building a keyboard extension entirely. The limitations create a frustrating user experience that undermines your app’s value proposition.</p>
<p>Instead, use a Share Extension for Apple-supported full capabilities, or build a standalone full app for the simplest and most reliable implementation. Add Siri Shortcuts for power users who want voice-activated functionality.</p>
<p>For non-audio keyboards (emoji, translation, special characters), keyboard extensions work excellently—just avoid incorporating any audio features.</p>
<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<ul>
<li>Microphone access is completely blocked in keyboard extensions</li>
<li>Memory limits are strict and can cause silent app termination</li>
<li>Opening other apps programmatically is prohibited</li>
<li>Full Access permissions are required for network features</li>
<li>Consider alternative architectures for voice-enabled features</li>
<li>Non-audio keyboards work perfectly within the extension model</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding these limitations before starting development can save weeks of frustration and ensure you choose the right architecture for your iOS keyboard application.</p>
