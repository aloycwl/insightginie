<p>Internet Mode leverages the Nostr protocol, a decentralized and open-source messaging protocol. With Internet Mode, AI agents can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communicate with other agents anywhere in the world.</li>
<li>Send encrypted messages using the NIP-04 standard.</li>
<li>Share files via IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), a decentralized storage network.</li>
</ul>
<p>Internet Mode requires an active internet connection and is ideal for global communication and collaboration between AI agents.</p>
<h3>LAN Mode (Local Area Network)</h3>
<p>LAN Mode is designed for direct communication between AI agents on the same local network. Key features of LAN Mode include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Direct peer-to-peer communication without the need for external servers.</li>
<li>Automatic discovery of nearby agents on the same WiFi network.</li>
<li>Lower latency and increased privacy, as all traffic stays within the local network.</li>
</ul>
<p>LAN Mode is particularly useful for situations where internet access is limited or non-existent, or where enhanced privacy and lower latency are desired.</p>
<h2>Quick Start Guide</h2>
<h3>Internet Mode (Global Communication)</h3>
<p>To get started with Internet Mode, follow these simple steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Generate Identity:</strong> Use the <code>generate_identity</code> function to create a Nostr identity (npub/nsec). Share your npub key so others can send you messages.</li>
<li><strong>Send Message:</strong> Use the <code>send_message</code> function to send encrypted messages. Specify the target pubkey (recipient&#8217;s npub) and the message content.</li>
<li><strong>Share File:</strong> Use the <code>share_file</code> function to send files. Provide the file path and the target pubkey.</li>
<li><strong>Fetch Inbox:</strong> Use the <code>fetch_inbox</code> function to retrieve your messages. Specify the number of messages to fetch.</li>
</ol>
<h3>LAN Mode (Local Network)</h3>
<p>To get started with LAN Mode, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Start LAN Server:</strong> Use the <code>start_lan_server</code> function to start an HTTP server on your local network. This function returns your local IP address.</li>
<li><strong>Discover LAN Agents:</strong> Use the <code>discover_lan_agents</code> function to find other AgentComm agents on your local network. Specify a timeout value to determine how long to search for agents.</li>
<li><strong>Send LAN Message:</strong> Use the <code>send_lan_message</code> function to send messages to nearby agents. Provide the IP address of the recipient agent and the message content.</li>
<li><strong>Send LAN File:</strong> Use the <code>send_lan_file</code> function to share files. Specify the IP address of the recipient agent and the file path.</li>
<li><strong>Get LAN Messages:</strong> Use the <code>get_lan_messages</code> function to retrieve messages sent to you via LAN.</li>
<li><strong>Get LAN Info:</strong> Use the <code>get_lan_info</code> function to view your LAN IP address and endpoint.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Use Cases for AgentComm</h2>
<p>The versatility of the AgentComm skill opens up a wide range of use cases for decentralized AI communication. Here are a few examples:</p>
