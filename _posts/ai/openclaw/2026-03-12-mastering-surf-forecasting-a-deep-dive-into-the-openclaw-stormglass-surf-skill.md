<h1>Understanding the OpenClaw Stormglass Surf Skill</h1>
<p>In the world of automated data retrieval and agent-based task management, having access to real-time, reliable information is paramount. For ocean enthusiasts, surfers, and developers building marine-focused applications, the <strong>OpenClaw Stormglass Surf Skill</strong> stands out as a powerful utility. This blog post explores what this tool does, how it works, and why it is a game-changer for those needing structured surf and weather data.</p>
<h2>What is the OpenClaw Stormglass Surf Skill?</h2>
<p>The Stormglass Surf Skill is a specialized tool designed to fetch surf-relevant ocean conditions from the Stormglass API. Whether you are providing a service that alerts surfers to the best waves or automating reports for maritime safety, this skill acts as a bridge between complex meteorological data and usable, machine-readable JSON output.</p>
<p>By abstracting the complexity of API queries, the skill allows users to request information using simple commands. You can specify a location via a human-readable string (like &#8220;Highcliffe Beach&#8221;) or provide precise geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude). The result is a consistent, reliable data structure that downstream applications can immediately utilize.</p>
<h2>Core Features and Functionality</h2>
<p>The skill is built with flexibility in mind, making it suitable for both casual experimentation and robust cron-driven agent pipelines. Below are some of its primary capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Flexible Location Targeting:</strong> You can either use a spot name (which is resolved through geocoding) or define an exact point on the globe using coordinates.</li>
<li><strong>Horizon Forecasting:</strong> Users can specify the time window for their forecast, ranging from current conditions (&#8216;now&#8217;) to a 72-hour future outlook.</li>
<li><strong>Comprehensive Metrics:</strong> The output includes critical data points such as wave height, swell period, swell direction, wind speed, wind gusts, and water temperature.</li>
<li><strong>Automated Output:</strong> By defaulting to JSON, the skill ensures that developers don&#8217;t have to spend hours writing parsers. The data is &#8220;clean&#8221; and ready for consumption.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How it Works: The Credential and Execution Matrix</h2>
<p>To use the skill, you primarily need a <strong>STORMGLASS_API_KEY</strong>. The script manages the complexity of API authentication, and depending on your chosen input mode, it may also require a Google Geocoding API key if you choose to search by place name (though it falls back to OpenStreetMap if preferred).</p>
<p>The execution is simple. For an automated system (cron job), a developer might execute the following command:</p>
<p><code>python scripts/surf_report.py --location "Highcliffe Beach" --horizon 72h --output json</code></p>
<p>This command instructs the script to identify the beach, query the Stormglass API for the next three days of conditions, and return the data as a structured JSON object. This eliminates the need for manual browsing or screen-scraping, which are prone to breaking.</p>
<h2>Why Developers Love This Skill</h2>
<p>The true power of this utility lies in its <strong>Output Contract</strong>. When working with external APIs, inconsistency is often the biggest hurdle. The Stormglass Surf Skill enforces a stable schema, meaning that top-level keys like <code>meta</code>, <code>location</code>, <code>now</code>, and <code>forecast</code> are guaranteed to exist.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it handles missing data gracefully. Rather than returning an incorrect value (like a zero), it returns <code>null</code> when a specific metric is unavailable. This is critical for downstream agents that need to distinguish between &#8216;calm seas&#8217; (0 meters) and &#8216;data not available&#8217; (null).</p>
<h2>Setting Up Your First Report</h2>
<p>If you are looking to get started, the project provides a &#8220;mock&#8221; mode. This is an incredible feature for testing your code without exhausting your Stormglass API credits. By using the <code>--mock</code> flag, you can simulate a request and verify that your pipeline processes the data correctly without ever making an external network call.</p>
<p>For those who want to take it a step further, the repository includes normalization scripts. These scripts ensure that even if different regions return slightly different formats, your end application receives a standardized input that is ready for dashboards, mobile alerts, or even voice-controlled assistants.</p>
<h2>Real-World Use Cases</h2>
<p>Imagine building a smart mirror that shows you the surf report as you drink your coffee, or a home automation system that dims your living room lights if the wave height exceeds a certain threshold. Because the OpenClaw skill outputs standard JSON, it can be easily plugged into platforms like Home Assistant, Node-RED, or custom Python-based bot platforms.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The OpenClaw Stormglass Surf Skill is more than just a wrapper for an API; it is a robust, well-documented tool that simplifies the extraction of oceanographic data. Whether you are a surfer looking to optimize your schedule or a developer creating the next great marine app, this skill provides the structure and reliability you need to succeed. By handling the heavy lifting of geocoding, API authentication, and data normalization, it allows you to focus on what matters: building the features that your users care about.</p>
