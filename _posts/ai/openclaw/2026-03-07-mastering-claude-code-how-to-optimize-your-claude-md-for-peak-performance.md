<h1>Mastering Claude Code: The Art of the Optimized CLAUDE.md</h1>
<p>If you are using Claude Code to automate your development workflow, you have likely encountered the CLAUDE.md file. This file acts as the project manual for your AI assistant, telling it how to handle your specific codebase. However, many developers fall into the trap of writing bloated, over-explained documents that actually cause the AI to become less effective. This is where the <strong>Claude-Optimised</strong> skill within the OpenClaw repository becomes an essential tool.</p>
<h2>What is the Claude-Optimised Skill?</h2>
<p>The Claude-Optimised skill is a set of best practices and guiding principles for maintaining your project&#8217;s <code>CLAUDE.md</code> file. Found within the <code>openclaw/skills</code> GitHub repository, this skill isn&#8217;t just a list of instructions; it is a philosophy of &#8216;Less Is More.&#8217; Its primary purpose is to ensure that your AI assistant remains responsive, accurate, and aligned with your project’s architecture without being bogged down by redundant instructions.</p>
<h2>The Core Principle: Why Less Is More</h2>
<p>The most important takeaway from the Claude-Optimised guide is simple: long documents are ignored. When you feed an LLM like Claude a massive, 200-line markdown file, critical instructions become buried in the noise. The model often struggles to prioritize the rules that actually matter, leading to hallucinations or deviations from your expected coding style.</p>
<p>The Claude-Optimised skill challenges you to look at every single line in your <code>CLAUDE.md</code> and ask: <em>&#8220;Would removing this cause Claude to make a mistake?&#8221;</em> If the answer is no, or if Claude already follows that behavior by default, the rule should be deleted. This ensures that the context window remains focused on the high-value, project-specific rules that the model cannot deduce on its own.</p>
<h2>What to Include in Your CLAUDE.md</h2>
<p>According to the skill, your focus should be on high-value, non-obvious project constraints. Effective sections include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Project Context:</strong> A one-line summary (e.g., &#8220;Next.js e-commerce app with Stripe&#8221;).</li>
<li><strong>Essential Commands:</strong> Only the specific commands needed for testing, building, and linting.</li>
<li><strong>Critical Gotchas:</strong> Rules about files that should never be touched or specific architectural boundaries.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Obvious Conventions:</strong> If your project uses <code>vi</code> for state instead of <code>useState</code>, this is the place to document it.</li>
<li><strong>Domain Terminology:</strong> Define your specific project vocabulary to prevent communication breakdowns.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What to Exclude</h2>
<p>One of the biggest anti-patterns in AI project management is &#8216;aspirational rule-setting.&#8217; Do not include instructions like &#8216;write clean code&#8217; or &#8216;follow standard practices.&#8217; Claude already knows how to code; telling it to be &#8216;clean&#8217; adds zero value and consumes tokens. Furthermore, avoid duplicating rules across multiple files or including theoretical concerns that haven&#8217;t actually caused issues in your build process.</p>
<h2>Structuring for Success</h2>
<p>The Claude-Optimised skill provides a recommended structure that is designed to be parsed quickly by the AI. By using Markdown headings, you prevent &#8216;instruction bleed,&#8217; where a rule intended for one module accidentally influences the AI&#8217;s behavior in an unrelated part of the app. The suggested structure is:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Project Header:</strong> Name and brief description.</li>
<li><strong>Commands:</strong> Concise bullet points for terminal tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Code Style:</strong> Only the project-specific deviations.</li>
<li><strong>Architecture:</strong> A brief overview for complex systems.</li>
<li><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> A section for critical, non-negotiable rules.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Maintenance: The Pruning Workflow</h2>
<p>A <code>CLAUDE.md</code> file is a living document. The Claude-Optimised skill suggests a cyclical maintenance workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Initialization:</strong> Run the <code>/init</code> command as your starting point.</li>
<li><strong>Aggressive Pruning:</strong> Every few weeks, challenge yourself to remove sections. If you find yourself asking, &#8216;Does this rule actually change behavior?&#8217;, test it. If the behavior remains the same, remove the rule.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Updates:</strong> When Claude misbehaves, don&#8217;t just add a generic rule. Add a specific, targeted instruction that solves the immediate problem. If the AI ignores your rules, it is a sign that your file is already too long and needs pruning.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why This Matters for Your Workflow</h2>
<p>Developers who adopt the Claude-Optimised mindset see immediate improvements in AI reliability. By reducing the clutter, you increase the &#8216;attention density&#8217; of the LLM. It spends less time trying to interpret vague, redundant instructions and more time successfully executing the specific, high-priority tasks that define your project&#8217;s unique stack and requirements.</p>
<p>By treating your <code>CLAUDE.md</code> as a high-performance configuration file rather than a general documentation page, you turn Claude from a simple code generator into a highly specialized project assistant that understands the nuance of your codebase perfectly. Start applying these principles today by visiting the OpenClaw repository and auditing your current <code>CLAUDE.md</code> configuration.</p>
