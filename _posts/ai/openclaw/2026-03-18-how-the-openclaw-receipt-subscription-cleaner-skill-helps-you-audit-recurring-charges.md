<h1>Understanding the OpenClaw Receipt Subscription Cleaner Skill</h1>
<p>In today’s digital economy, most people juggle dozens of recurring charges ranging from streaming services and software licenses to gym memberships and subscription boxes. Keeping track of what you are paying for, when each charge renews, and whether prices have changed can quickly become overwhelming. The OpenClaw skill named <strong>receipt-subscription-cleaner</strong> is designed to solve exactly this problem. It takes raw receipt data—whether exported from email, collected as PDFs, or supplied as a CSV list—and turns it into a clean, actionable overview of all recurring charges. Importantly, the skill never initiates payments, cancellations, or refunds; it works in a read‑only mode and only produces drafts that you can review and act on yourself.</p>
<h2>Core Purpose and Intended Audience</h2>
<p>The primary goal of the receipt‑subscription‑cleaner skill is to extract and normalize receipt information to detect subscriptions, identify their renewal cycles, and surface potential savings opportunities. It is best suited for users who have access to their purchase history in a format they can export—such as an email archive, a folder of PDF invoices, or a spreadsheet of transaction lines. If you want to audit your spending without making any automatic changes, this skill provides the insights you need while staying safely within read‑only boundaries.</p>
<p>Typical users include freelancers who need to monitor business expenses, families trying to trim household costs, and anyone preparing for a financial review or budgeting exercise. By focusing on the data you already possess, the skill removes the guesswork and lets you see exactly where your money goes each month.</p>
<h2>Required Inputs</h2>
<p>To get started, the skill expects three main pieces of information:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Receipt sources</strong>: This can be an email export (e.g., an mbox file or a set of forwarded messages), a folder containing PDF receipts, or a CSV file that lists each transaction with vendor, amount, and date.</li>
<li><strong>Time window and base currency</strong>: You specify the period you want to analyze (for example, the last 12 months) and the currency in which you want the summary expressed. The skill will convert amounts if needed, using the exchange rates you provide or a built‑in fallback.</li>
<li><strong>Known subscriptions or vendors to prioritize</strong>: Optionally, you can give a list of vendors you already know are subscription‑based. This helps the algorithm focus its detection efforts and improves confidence scores for those entries.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, you can set user preferences for reminders, such as how often you’d like to be notified about upcoming renewals and which timezone to use for those reminders. These preferences shape the final reminder schedule that the skill outputs.</p>
<h2>How the Skill Processes Receipt Data</h2>
<p>Once the inputs are supplied, the receipt‑subscription‑cleaner follows a multi‑stage pipeline:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Ingestion and normalization</strong>: The skill reads each receipt, extracts relevant fields such as vendor name, transaction date, amount, and any descriptive text. Vendor names are normalized—variations like &#8220;Netflix, Inc.&#8221;, &#8220;Netflix&#8221; and &#8220;Netflix.com&#8221; are collapsed into a single canonical form.</li>
<li><strong>Clustering into potential subscriptions</strong>: Using the normalized vendor names and transaction dates, the algorithm groups charges that appear to belong to the same service. It looks for regular intervals (monthly, quarterly, annually) and consistent amounts, while allowing for minor fluctuations that might represent taxes or promotional discounts.</li>
<li><strong>Confidence scoring</strong>: Each detected subscription receives a confidence level based on how strongly the pattern matches a true recurring charge. High confidence entries show clear, repeatable cycles; lower confidence entries may need manual review.</li>
<li><strong>Renewal estimation</strong>: For each cluster, the skill predicts the next renewal date by extending the detected cycle from the most recent transaction. It also notes any observed price changes over the tracked period.</li>
</ol>
<p>All of this happens locally within your workspace; the skill does not upload your receipts to external servers unless you explicitly enable an optional integration.</p>
<h2>Expected Outputs</h2>
<p>The skill delivers several distinct artifacts that together give you a full picture of your recurring charges:</p>
<h3>Subscription Table</h3>
<p>The core output is a table that lists every detected subscription with the following columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vendor (normalized name)</li>
<li>Average amount per billing cycle</li>
<li>Detected cycle (monthly, quarterly, yearly, etc.)</li>
<li>Estimated next renewal date</li>
<li>Confidence level (high, medium, low)</li>
<li>Observed price trend (stable, increasing, decreasing)</li>
</ul>
<p>This table can be copied into a spreadsheet or exported as CSV for further analysis.</p>
<h3>Anomaly List</h3>
<p>Beyond the regular subscriptions, the skill flags anomalies that might indicate unwanted spending or errors. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sudden price jumps that exceed a defined threshold</li>
<li>Overlapping subscriptions from the same vendor (perhaps you signed up twice)</li>
<li>Charges that appear only once but match a known subscription pattern (possible forgotten trial conversion)</li>
<li>Subscriptions with very low confidence that may be false positives</li>
</ul>
<p>Each anomaly comes with a short explanation and a suggested action, such as verifying the charge with the vendor or reviewing the original receipt.</p>
<h3>Draft Cancellation Emails</h3>
<p>If you decide to cancel a subscription, the skill can generate a ready‑to‑send email template. The draft includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A polite greeting</li>
<li>Reference to your account details (you fill in the specific account number or email)</li>
<li>A clear statement of cancellation request</li>
<li>Ask for confirmation of cancellation and any final invoice</li>
<li>A closing thank you</li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly, the skill never sends these emails automatically; it merely provides the text for you to review, personalize, and send from your own email client.</p>
<h3>Reminder Schedule Recommendations</h3>
<p>Based on the renewal dates and your preferred reminder frequency, the skill outputs a calendar‑friendly schedule. You can import this into Google Calendar, Outlook, or any iCal‑compatible application. Each reminder includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The subscription name</li>
<li>The upcoming renewal date</li>
<li>The expected charge amount</li>
<li>A link to the original receipt (if you kept the source files)</li>
</ul>
<p>These reminders help you avoid surprise charges and give you a chance to evaluate whether a service is still worth keeping before it renews.</p>
<h2>Safety, Privacy, and Guardrails</h2>
<p>OpenClaw places a strong emphasis on user safety and data privacy. The receipt‑subscription‑cleaner skill adheres to the following principles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Read‑only operation</strong>: The skill never initiates a payment, refund, or cancellation. All modifications remain drafts unless you explicitly act on them.</li>
<li><strong>Data locality</strong>: Raw receipts are processed within your own workspace and are not stored externally unless you opt‑in to a specific integration that you control.</li>
<li><strong>Redaction of sensitive data</strong>: Any credit‑card numbers, bank account details, or full addresses that might appear in receipts are automatically redacted from the output, ensuring that no personally identifiable financial information is exposed in the summary or drafts.</li>
<li><strong>Safe mode</strong>: In its default configuration the skill runs in safe mode, which limits functionality to analysis and draft generation only. Advanced features that could interact with payment gateways are disabled.</li>
</ul>
<p>These safeguards make the skill appropriate for use in both personal and professional environments where data sensitivity is a concern.</p>
<h2>Practical Use Cases</h2>
<p>Consider a scenario where you have just finished your annual tax preparation and want to review your recurring expenses for the next year. You export your email receipts for the past 12 months, point the skill at that folder, set the base currency to USD, and ask for monthly reminders. Within minutes you receive a tidy table showing that you are paying for three streaming services you barely watch, a software license that renewed at a 20 % higher price, and a gym membership you haven’t used in months. The anomaly list highlights the price increase and the overlapping membership from a partner brand. You review the draft cancellation emails, customize them with your account info, and send them out. Finally, you import the reminder schedule into your phone’s calendar, so you get a nudge a few days before each renewal, giving you a final chance to keep or cancel.</p>
<p>Another use case is for small business owners who need to track SaaS subscriptions across multiple team members. By feeding the skill a consolidated CSV of expense reports, they can quickly see which tools are duplicated, which are underutilized, and where consolidating licenses could save money.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The OpenClaw receipt‑subscription‑cleaner skill turns a messy pile of receipts into a clear, actionable audit of your recurring financial commitments. It does so without ever moving money or making changes on your behalf, keeping you firmly in control. By providing a normalized subscription table, anomaly detection, ready‑to‑send cancellation drafts, and intelligent reminder recommendations, the skill empowers you to make informed decisions about where to cut costs and how to stay on top of upcoming payments. If you regularly export receipts from your email or keep PDF invoices, giving this skill a try could uncover hidden savings and simplify your financial oversight—all with a few clicks and zero risk to your payment methods.</p>
