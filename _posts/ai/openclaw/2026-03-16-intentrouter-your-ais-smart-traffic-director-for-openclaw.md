<h2>Introduction: Meet Your AI&#8217;s Smart Traffic Director</h2>
<p>In the complex world of AI task management, knowing which model to use for which job can feel like guesswork. That&#8217;s where IntentRouter comes in—your intelligent traffic director that precisely matches OpenClaw tasks to the perfect LLM model every time.</p>
<p>IntentRouter analyzes your tasks and directs them to the best LLM for the job: MiniMax 2.5 for code, Kimi k2.5 for creative work, Grok Fast for research, and more. This security-focused skill eliminates the guesswork and routes with purpose, ensuring you get optimal results without exposing sensitive credentials.</p>
<h2>What IntentRouter Does</h2>
<p>IntentRouter is a sophisticated routing system that acts as an intelligent intermediary between your OpenClaw tasks and the appropriate language model. Think of it as a smart traffic director for your AI workloads—it examines what you need to accomplish and directs that task to the most suitable model available through OpenRouter.</p>
<p>The skill operates on a tiered system, categorizing tasks based on their nature and complexity. Whether you&#8217;re writing creative content, debugging code, conducting research, or building applications, IntentRouter ensures your task reaches the model best equipped to handle it efficiently and effectively.</p>
<h2>Key Features and Benefits</h2>
<h3>Intelligent Model Selection</h3>
<p>IntentRouter automatically categorizes tasks and selects the optimal model based on your specific use case. The system recognizes patterns in your requests and matches them to pre-configured model preferences, ensuring you always get the right tool for the job.</p>
<h3>Security-Focused Design</h3>
<p>Security is paramount in IntentRouter v1.7.0. The skill has been designed to never expose gateway authentication secrets in its output. Gateway management functionality has been removed entirely, requiring users to employ the separate gateway-guard skill for authentication management.</p>
<h3>OpenRouter Integration</h3>
<p>All model IDs use the openrouter/ prefix, and the system is configured to work seamlessly with OpenRouter API keys. This unified approach means you only need one authentication profile to access every tier of models available through the skill.</p>
<h3>Default Orchestrator Model</h3>
<p>Gemini 2.5 Flash serves as the default orchestrator model—fast, cost-effective, and reliable for tool-calling operations. When you&#8217;re the main agent and receive a task, you delegate it rather than handling it yourself, maintaining a clean separation of concerns.</p>
<h2>How IntentRouter Works</h2>
<p>The routing process follows a specific, mandatory flow that ensures consistency and reliability:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Task Analysis</strong>: When you receive a user task (code, research, writing, design, etc.), IntentRouter analyzes the request to determine the appropriate tier and model.</li>
<li><strong>Spawn Parameters</strong>: Run the router with the task to get spawn parameters in JSON format, which includes the task, model selection, and session target.</li>
<li><strong>Delegation</strong>: Immediately call sessions_spawn with the exact model and parameters provided by the router. Never modify the model value.</li>
<li><strong>Result Forwarding</strong>: Forward the sub-agent&#8217;s reply to the user, clearly indicating which model actually ran.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Model Selection by Use Case</h2>
<p>IntentRouter uses a comprehensive model matrix to ensure optimal task-to-model matching:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Default/Orchestrator</strong>: Gemini 2.5 Flash (fast, cheap, reliable)</li>
<li><strong>Reasoning</strong>: GLM-5, MiniMax 2.5</li>
<li><strong>Creative/Frontend</strong>: Kimi k2.5</li>
<li><strong>Research</strong>: Grok Fast</li>
<li><strong>Code/Engineering</strong>: MiniMax 2.5, Qwen2.5-Coder</li>
<li><strong>Quality/Complex</strong>: GLM 4.7 Flash, GLM 4.7, Sonnet 4, GPT-4o</li>
<li><strong>Vision/Images</strong>: GPT-4o</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tier Detection System</h2>
<p>The skill uses sophisticated keyword detection to classify tasks into appropriate tiers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FAST</strong>: Simple operations like check, get, list, show, status, monitor, fetch</li>
<li><strong>REASONING</strong>: Logic and analysis tasks like prove, logic, analyze, derive, math</li>
<li><strong>CREATIVE</strong>: Writing, design, and creative tasks</li>
<li><strong>RESEARCH</strong>: Information gathering and lookup tasks</li>
<li><strong>CODE</strong>: Programming, debugging, and implementation tasks</li>
<li><strong>QUALITY</strong>: Complex architectural and system design tasks</li>
<li><strong>VISION</strong>: Image and visual content tasks</li>
</ul>
<h2>Usage Examples</h2>
<h3>CLI Commands</h3>
<p>Basic usage includes:</p>
<pre><code>python scripts/router.py default          # Show default model
python scripts/router.py classify "fix lint errors"  # Classify task to tier + model
python scripts/router.py spawn --json "write a poem"  # Get JSON for sessions_spawn
python scripts/router.py models          # List all available models
</code></pre>
<h3>Creative Task Example</h3>
<p>For a creative task like writing a poem:</p>
<pre><code>router output: {"task":"write a poem","model":"openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5","sessionTarget":"isolated"}
→ sessions_spawn(task="write a poem", model="openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5", sessionTarget="isolated")
</code></pre>
<h3>Code Task Example</h3>
<p>For a code task like fixing a login bug:</p>
<pre><code>router output: {"task":"fix the login bug","model":"openrouter/minimax/minimax-m2.5","sessionTarget":"isolated"}
→ sessions_spawn(task="fix the login bug", model="openrouter/minimax/minimax-m2.5", sessionTarget="isolated")
</code></pre>
<h2>Security and Best Practices</h2>
<h3>Output Hygiene</h3>
<p>IntentRouter maintains strict output hygiene by never returning internal orchestration metadata to users. This means no session keys, transcript paths, runtime statistics, or internal instructions are exposed in the final output.</p>
<h3>Hard-Stop Rules</h3>
<p>If sessions_spawn fails or is skipped, the system returns only the delegation error and next-step fix. It never attempts to perform the task directly, maintaining the integrity of the delegation model.</p>
<h3>Classification vs. Execution</h3>
<p>The classify command is for diagnostics only. Real user tasks must use the spawn &#8211;json approach followed by sessions_spawn for actual execution.</p>
<h2>Why IntentRouter Matters</h2>
<p>In the evolving landscape of AI development, IntentRouter represents a significant advancement in how we manage and optimize AI workloads. By intelligently matching tasks to the most appropriate models, it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduces costs by using the right model for each task</li>
<li>Improves performance by leveraging model strengths</li>
<li>Enhances security by eliminating credential exposure</li>
<li>Simplifies workflow by automating model selection</li>
<li>Maintains consistency through standardized routing protocols</li>
</ul>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To begin using IntentRouter, ensure you have:</p>
<ol>
<li>OpenRouter API key configured in your OpenClaw setup</li>
<li>Gateway authentication managed separately via gateway-guard skill</li>
<li>Access to the skill directory and Python environment</li>
</ol>
<p>From there, you can start delegating tasks using the standard spawn &#8211;json workflow, confident that IntentRouter will handle the routing intelligently and securely.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>IntentRouter transforms how you interact with AI models by providing intelligent, secure, and efficient task routing. Whether you&#8217;re a developer, content creator, researcher, or business professional, this skill ensures your OpenClaw tasks always reach the right model for optimal results.</p>
<p>By combining sophisticated classification algorithms, security best practices, and seamless OpenRouter integration, IntentRouter represents the future of AI task management—where the right model meets the right task at the right time, every time.</p>
