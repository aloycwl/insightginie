<h1>understanding the skulk skill scanner: your openclaw agent security tool</h1>
<p>the world of open-source artificial intelligence is expanding, and with it comes the need for robust security measures. openclaw is a platform that allows users to create, share, and utilize custom skills for their agents. however, with shared resources always comes the risk of malicious behavior. this is where the <a href="https://github.com/openclaw/skills/blob/main/skills/skills/adainthelab/skulk-skill-scanner/SKILL.md">skulk skill scanner</a> comes into play. this tool is designed to help users identify potential security risks in openclaw skills before they install or publish them.</p>
<h2>what is the skulk skill scanner?</h2>
<p>the skulk skill scanner is a powerful open-source command-line tool that scans openclaw skill folders for potential security red flags. it&#8217;s designed to detect various types of malicious patterns, including data exfiltration, credential theft, prompt injection, destructive commands <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_injection">[[1]](#references)</a>, obfuscation, privilege escalation, and supply chain risks <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_attack">[[2]](#references)</a>.</p>
<p>this tool is particularly useful when you&#8217;re evaluating a skill from clawhub before installing it, auditing your own skills before publishing, or reviewing any skill.md file for safety. however, it&#8217;s important to note that the skulk skill scanner is specifically designed for openclaw skills and not for general code review or vulnerability scanning of non-skill codebases.</p>
<h2>how does the skulk skill scanner work?</h2>
<p>the skulk skill scanner is a static analysis tool, meaning it scans the code for patterns and potential security threats without executing the code. it uses a set of predefined rules to identify potential issues. each rule is assigned a severity level: critical, high, medium, and info.</p>
<p>based on these severity levels, the tool deducts points from the overall score. critical issues deduct 30 points, high issues deduct 15 points, medium issues deduct 5 points, and info issues deduct 0 points. the final score determines whether the skill passes, warns, or fails.</p>
<p>&#8211; score 75-100: ✅ pass<br />
&#8211; score 50-74: ⚠️ warn<br />
&#8211; score 0-49 or any critical issue: ❌ fail</p>
<p>if the skill fails the scan, the tool returns an exit code of 1, which is useful for integration with continuous integration (ci) pipeline</p>
<h2>what does the skulk skill scanner catch?</h2>
<p>the skulk skill scanner is designed to catch a range of security issues. here&#8217;s a breakdown of what it flags at each severity level:</p>
<h3>🔴 critical</h3>
<ul>
<li>data exfiltration: unauthorized transfer of data from your system.</li>
<li>credential access: illicit collection of usernames, passwords, or other sensitive information.</li>
<li>safety overrides: attempts to bypass or disable security measures.</li>
<li>destructive commands: commands that can delete or modify files or data in a harmful way.</li>
</ul>
<h3>🟠 high</h3>
<ul>
<li>obfuscation: use of encoding (like base64) or eval functions to hide malicious code.</li>
<li>unknown network access: connections to unknown or suspicious domains.</li>
<li>environment scanning: attempts to gather information about the system or network.</li>
<li>privilege escalation: attempts to gain higher levels of access or permissions.</li>
<li>hidden instructions: commands that are not visible or apparent in the code.</li>
</ul>
<h3>🟡 medium</h3>
<ul>
<li>writes outside workspace: attempts to write or modify files outside of the designated workspace.</li>
<li>package installs: installation of additional packages, which could potentially contain malicious code.</li>
<li>messaging on user&#8217;s behalf: sending messages or commands that appear to come from the user.</li>
<li>persistent timers/automation: setting up automated tasks or timers that run continuously.</li>
</ul>
<h3>🔵 info</h3>
<ul>
<li>api key references: mention or use of api keys, which could potentially be compromised.</li>
<li>broad tool access requests: requests for broad or general access to tools or systems.</li>
</ul>
<h2>safe domain allowlist</h2>
<p>to reduce false positives on network-related rules, the skulk skill scanner includes a safe domain allowlist. this list contains known legitimate api domains. you can customize this list by editing the <code>safe_domains</code> array in the scanner.js file.</p>
<h2>limitations of the skulk skill scanner</h2>
<p>while the skulk skill scanner is a powerful tool, it&#8217;s important to remember that it has its limitations. as a static analysis tool, it relies on pattern matching and cannot detect:</p>
<ul>
<li>sophisticated multi-step social engineering attacks.</li>
<li>runtime-generated urls or dynamic exfiltration.</li>
<li>attacks that are designed to look identical to legitimate skill behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p>the skulk skill scanner is a first line of defense, not a guarantee of safety. it&#8217;s crucial to always review skills manually before granting them sensitive access to your systems.</p>
<h2>how to use the skulk skill scanner</h2>
<p>the skulk skill scanner is easy to use. here are a few examples of how you can use it:</p>
<h3>scan a downloaded skill folder before enabling it</h3>
<pre><code>clawhub inspect some-skill
node scripts/scanner.js ./skills/some-skill --verbose</code></pre>
<h3>scan your own skill before publishing</h3>
<pre><code>node scripts/scanner.js ./skills/my-skill</code></pre>
<h3>json output for automation</h3>
<pre><code>node scripts/scanner.js ./skills/my-skill --json</code></pre>
<h3>one-line summary output for heartbeat checks</h3>
<pre><code>node scripts/scanner.js ./skills/my-skill --summary</code></pre>
<h3>include scanner internals (off by default to reduce self-scan noise)</h3>
<pre><code>node scripts/scanner.js ./skills/skulk-skill-scanner --include-self</code></pre>
<h2>conclusion</h2>
<p>in a world where ai tools are increasingly becoming a part of our daily lives, ensuring their security is paramount. the skulk skill scanner is a powerful tool that helps protect you and your systems by identifying potential security risks in openclaw skills. while it&#8217;s not a cure-all, it&#8217;s an important first step in securing your ai-powered tools.</p>
<p>so, the next time you&#8217;re about to install a new openclaw skill, remember to run it through the skulk skill scanner first. it&#8217;s a small step that can help ensure the safety and security of your systems.</p>
