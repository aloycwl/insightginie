<h1>Mastering Govee Control: A Comprehensive Guide to API Integration and Management</h1>
<p>The openclaw/govee-control skill is a powerful tool designed to simplify the process of controlling Govee smart devices through the Govee OpenAPI. This script-free solution provides a secure and efficient way to manage your Govee devices directly from the command line. In this comprehensive guide, we&#8217;ll walk through the setup process, explore the various control commands, and highlight best practices for secure key handling.</p>
<h2>Understanding the Govee OpenAPI</h2>
<p>The Govee OpenAPI allows users to control their Govee devices programmatically. This API is restful and uses HTTPS endpoints, ensuring secure communication. The openclaw/govee-control skill provides a huge advantage by offering a straightforward way to interact with this API without the need for scripting. Let&#8217;s break down the key features and requirements of this skill.</p>
<h2>Prerequisites and Setup</h2>
<p>Before diving into controlling your Govee devices, there are a few prerequisites you need to ensure are in place:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux system with bash support</li>
<li>curl installed (for making HTTP requests)</li>
<li>Internet access to <code>https://developer-api.govee.com</code> and <code>https://developer.govee.com</code></li>
<li>Govee account with supported devices linked</li>
<li>jq installed (optional, for pretty-printing JSON responses)</li>
</ul>
<p>To verify these prerequisites, you can run the following commands in your terminal:</p>
<pre><code>bash --version | head -n 1
curl --version | head -n 1
command -v jq > /dev/null && jq --version || echo "jq not installed (optional)"</code></pre>
<h2>Obtaining a Govee API Key</h2>
<p>The Govee API key is essential for authenticating your requests to the Govee OpenAPI. Here&#8217;s how to generate your API key:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visit the <a href="https://developer.govee.com/">Govee Developer Portal</a>.</li>
<li>Sign in using your Govee account credentials.</li>
<li>Navigate to the API key section in the developer console.</li>
<li>Generate or apply for a new API key and copy it for use in your commands.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s crucial to treat your API key like a password. Ensure it&#8217;s kept private and never hardcoded in scripts or shared publicly.</p>
<h2>Secure Local Storage: Keeping Your API Key Safe</h2>
<p>To maintain the security of your Govee API key, it&#8217;s recommended to store it in a per-user secrets file rather than root directories. Follow these steps to securely store your API key:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir -p "$HOME/.openclaw/secrets"
echo "export GOVEE_API_KEY='<YOUR_API_KEY>'" > "$HOME/.openclaw/secrets/govee.env"
chmod 600 "$HOME/.openclaw/secrets/govee.env"
source "$HOME/.openclaw/secrets/govee.env"</code></pre>
<p>This approach ensures the API key is only accessible to the specific user and not exposed in logs or shared directories. It also avoids exposing the key when sourcing other environment variable files.</p>
<h2>Discovering Your Govee Devices</h2>
<p>Before you can control your Govee devices, you need to identify the specific device and model you want to manage. For this, use the following command to list all devices registered under your account:</p>
<pre><code>curl -sS -X GET "https://developer-api.govee.com/v1/devices" \
-H "Govee-API-Key: $GOVEE_API_KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json"</code></pre>
<p>This command returns a list of devices along with their model IDs. Note down the <code>device</code> and <code>model</code> values for the device you want to control.</p>
<h2>Checking Device State</h2>
<p>To view the current state of a specific Govee device, use the following command, replacing <code>&lt;DEVICE&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;MODEL&gt;</code> with the corresponding values you obtained in the previous step:</p>
<pre><code>curl -sS -X GET "https://developer-api.govee.com/v1/devices/state?device=<DEVICE>&model=<MODEL>" \
-H "Govee-API-Key: $GOVEE_API_KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json"</code></pre>
<p>The response will include information about the current state of your device, such as power status, brightness level, and color settings (if applicable).</p>
<h2>Mastering Device Control Commands</h2>
<p>The openclaw/govee-control skill provides several commands to control your Govee devices. Below are the primary control commands you can use:</p>
<h3>Turn On</h3>
<pre><code>curl -sS -X PUT "https://developer-api.govee.com/v1/devices/control" \
-H "Govee-API-Key: $GOVEE_API_KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"device":"<DEVICE>","model":"<MODEL>","cmd":{"name":"turn","value":"on"}}'</code></pre>
<h3>Turn Off</h3>
<pre><code>curl -sS -X PUT "https://developer-api.govee.com/v1/devices/control" \
-H "Govee-API-Key: $GOVEE_API_KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"device":"<DEVICE>","model":"<MODEL>","cmd":{"name":"turn","value":"off"}}'</code></pre>
<h3>Adjust Brightness (1-100)</h3>
<pre><code>curl -sS -X PUT "https://developer-api.govee.com/v1/devices/control" \
-H "Govee-API-Key: $GOVEE_API_KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"device":"<DEVICE>","model":"<MODEL>","cmd":{"name":"brightness","value":75}}'</code></pre>
<p>You can replace the value <code>75</code> with any number between 1 and 100 to set the desired brightness level.</p>
<h3>Change Color (RGB Values)</h3>
<pre><code>curl -sS -X PUT "https://developer-api.govee.com/v1/devices/control" \
-H "Govee-API-Key: $GOVEE_API_KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"device":"<DEVICE>","model":"<MODEL>","cmd":{"name":"color","value":{"r":120,"g":180,"b":255}}}'</code></pre>
<p>Replace the RGB values <code>r</code>, <code>g</code>, and <code>b</code> with your desired color values (each ranging from 0 to 255).</p>
<h2>API Response and Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>A successful command typically returns the following response:</p>
<pre><code>{
    "code": 200,
    "message": "Success"
}</code></pre>
<p>If the response code is not 200, it indicates a potential error. Here are some common error codes and their meanings:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>401 / unauthorized</code>: The API key is missing, expired, or invalid.</li>
<li><code>429 / rate limit</code>: You&#8217;ve exceeded the rate limit; try again later.</li>
<li>Command Rejected: The device model does not support the requested command. Check the <code>supportCmds</code> field in the device information.</li>
<li>Empty Device List: Your account has no supported devices linked. Ensure your devices are Govee OpenAPI compatible and properly linked to your account.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you encounter any issues, refer to the Govee Developer Portal documentation or contact Govee support for assistance.</p>
<h2>Best Practices and Security Guidelines</h2>
<p>To ensure the secure and efficient use of the openclaw/govee-control skill, follow these best practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Always use placeholders (<code>&lt;DEVICE&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;MODEL&gt;</code>, etc.) in documentation and guides.</li>
<li>Never include real API keys or device IDs in published artifacts or chat logs.</li>
<li>Prioritize one-device-at-a-time actions over bulk changes to minimize potential issues.</li>
<li>Avoid pasting API keys into chat platform, as this can compromise their security.</li>
<li>Familiarize yourself with the specific commands supported by your device model and the Govee OpenAPI capabilities.</li>
</ul>
