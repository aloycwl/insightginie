<h2>What is the Solo-Setup Skill?</h2>
<p>The solo-setup skill is an automated workflow configuration tool that creates comprehensive project setup documentation from existing project resources. It extracts information from CLAUDE.md, PRD documents, package manifests, and other configuration files to generate a complete workflow guide without requiring any manual input from the user.</p>
<p>This skill is particularly valuable for teams and individual developers who want to establish consistent development practices quickly, without spending hours manually documenting workflows or configuring project standards.</p>
<h2>How Solo-Setup Works</h2>
<p>The skill operates through a systematic, multi-step process that analyzes existing project data to create comprehensive workflow documentation. Here&#8217;s a detailed breakdown of how it functions:</p>
<h3>Project Detection and Verification</h3>
<p>The skill begins by identifying the project root directory. If arguments are provided, it searches for a project with that name in the current directory or a specified projects directory. Otherwise, it uses the current working directory. The skill then verifies the presence of essential files like CLAUDE.md, which contains technical stack information and architectural decisions.</p>
<p>If the required files aren&#8217;t found, the skill uses an interactive question system to gather necessary information from the user, ensuring it has all the data needed to create accurate workflow documentation.</p>
<h3>Comprehensive Data Collection</h3>
<p>Once the project location is confirmed, solo-setup performs parallel reads of multiple project files:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CLAUDE.md</strong> &#8211; Contains tech stack details, architecture decisions, available commands, and best practices</li>
<li><strong>docs/prd.md</strong> &#8211; Includes problem statements, user information, solution approaches, features, metrics, and pricing details</li>
<li><strong>package.json or pyproject.toml</strong> &#8211; Provides exact dependency versions and development dependencies</li>
<li><strong>Makefile</strong> &#8211; Lists available build and development commands</li>
<li><strong>Linter configurations</strong> &#8211; Includes .eslintrc*, eslint.config.*, .swiftlint.yml, ruff.toml, detekt.yml files</li>
</ul>
<p>This comprehensive data collection ensures the generated workflow documentation is accurate and reflects the actual project setup.</p>
<h3>Optional Ecosystem Integration</h3>
<p>For enhanced quality, the skill can optionally integrate with external ecosystem sources. It detects the stack name from CLAUDE.md and uses MCP tools like kb_search to find stack templates and development principles. If MCP tools aren&#8217;t available, it falls back to looking for local stack configuration files or deriving information directly from the collected project data.</p>
<h3>Language Detection and Configuration</h3>
<p>The skill automatically detects the primary programming languages used in the project by analyzing package manifests and configuration files:</p>
<ul>
<li>package.json → TypeScript</li>
<li>pyproject.toml → Python</li>
<li>*.xcodeproj or Package.swift → Swift</li>
<li>build.gradle.kts → Kotlin</li>
</ul>
<p>This language detection ensures the generated workflow documentation includes appropriate testing frameworks and development tools for the specific technology stack.</p>
<h3>Workflow Documentation Generation</h3>
<p>The core output of solo-setup is a comprehensive docs/workflow.md file that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TDD Policy</strong> &#8211; Defines testing philosophy (moderate, strict, or minimal)</li>
<li><strong>Test Framework</strong> &#8211; Specifies the exact testing framework based on devDependencies</li>
<li><strong>Commit Strategy</strong> &#8211; Implements conventional commits with proper formatting</li>
<li><strong>Verification Checkpoints</strong> &#8211; Lists steps to verify code quality after each phase</li>
<li><strong>Branch Strategy</strong> &#8211; Defines branch naming conventions and purposes</li>
</ul>
<p>The skill also updates CLAUDE.md to include references to the new workflow documentation, ensuring all project documentation remains interconnected and accessible.</p>
