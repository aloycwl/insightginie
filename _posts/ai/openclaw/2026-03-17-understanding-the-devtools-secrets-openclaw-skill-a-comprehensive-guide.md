<h2>What is the devtools-secrets OpenClaw Skill?</h2>
<p>The devtools-secrets skill is a specialized OpenClaw capability designed to provide comprehensive knowledge and guardrails for the mise + fnox + infisical secrets toolchain. This skill acts as an intelligent assistant when developers need to configure secrets, set up fnox, work with infisical, manage mise environments, or handle any aspect of secrets management in their development workflow.</p>
<h2>The Three-Tool Integration Chain</h2>
<p>The devtools-secrets skill orchestrates a powerful three-tool integration chain that works together seamlessly:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>mise</strong>: Task runner and environment manager that orchestrates development tooling, runs tasks, and manages environment variables through plugins</li>
<li><strong>fnox</strong>: Unified secret interface that abstracts over multiple secret backends (infisical, age, env files) with a single CLI</li>
<li><strong>infisical</strong>: Remote secrets backend that stores, syncs, and injects secrets from a central server</li>
</ul>
<p>These tools complement each other perfectly: infisical stores secrets remotely, fnox provides a unified local interface to them, and mise orchestrates tasks that consume secrets via fnox.</p>
<h2>Tool Availability Validation</h2>
<p>Before providing any configuration guidance, the devtools-secrets skill performs crucial tool availability validation. It checks whether mise, fnox, and infisical are installed on the system:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>mise validation</strong>: Checks if mise is installed and displays its version, or provides installation instructions if missing</li>
<li><strong>fnox validation</strong>: Verifies fnox installation and version, or suggests installation via mise</li>
<li><strong>infisical validation</strong>: Confirms infisical installation and version, or provides installation guidance</li>
</ul>
<p>If any tool shows as MISSING, the skill stops and helps the user install it before proceeding. This prevents configuration guidance for tools that aren&#8217;t available.</p>
<h2>Project Configuration State Assessment</h2>
<p>The skill examines the current project&#8217;s configuration state to understand what&#8217;s already set up:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>fnox.toml presence</strong>: Checks if the fnox configuration file exists, running fnox init if it doesn&#8217;t</li>
<li><strong>.infisical.json presence</strong>: Verifies the Infisical configuration file exists and displays its contents, or suggests running infisical init</li>
<li><strong>mise.toml env section</strong>: Looks for the environment section in mise configuration to understand current environment variable management</li>
</ul>
<h2>System and Global Configuration</h2>
<p>The skill also checks global configurations that affect the entire system:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>mise global config</strong>: Examines the global mise configuration file</li>
<li><strong>fnox global config</strong>: Checks the global fnox configuration</li>
<li><strong>infisical login status</strong>: Verifies if the user is logged into infisical and displays user information</li>
</ul>
<h2>Secrets Enforcement Mechanisms</h2>
<p>One of the most powerful aspects of this skill is its enforcement of secrets hygiene through always-on hooks defined in .claude/settings.json. These hooks are always active regardless of whether this skill is loaded:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>block-hardcoded-secrets.py</strong>: Blocks edit/write operations containing hardcoded API keys, tokens, passwords, or known secret prefixes (sk-, ghp_, AKIA, xox[bpras]-)</li>
<li><strong>block-bare-secret-exports.py</strong>: Blocks Bash commands that export secret-like env vars without wrapping in fnox exec or infisical run</li>
</ul>
<p>These enforcement mechanisms ensure that secrets are never accidentally exposed in code repositories or shell commands.</p>
<h2>Configuration Patterns and Best Practices</h2>
<p>The devtools-secrets skill provides detailed configuration patterns for each tool through reference files:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>mise integration</strong>: How to set up mise env plugins, tasks, and fnox integration</li>
<li><strong>fnox configuration</strong>: Structure of fnox.toml, providers, and profiles</li>
<li><strong>infisical patterns</strong>: Infisical CLI usage, scanning capabilities, and CI/CD integration</li>
</ul>
<h2>Common Gotchas and Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>The skill provides crucial guidance on common pitfalls and troubleshooting scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Order matters</strong>: fnox.toml must exist before fnox exec works; run fnox init if missing</li>
<li><strong>Profile mismatches</strong>: fnox profiles (dev/staging/prod) must match infisical environment slugs; mismatches return empty secrets silently</li>
<li><strong>.infisical.json safety</strong>: This file is safe to commit as it contains project IDs and workspace config, not secrets</li>
<li><strong>fnox.toml sensitivity</strong>: May contain sensitive paths; review before committing if using age-encrypted file provider</li>
<li><strong>mise env plugin behavior</strong>: Plugins run on cd; misconfiguration causes errors on every directory change</li>
<li><strong>infisical auth expiration</strong>: Login tokens have TTL; CI/CD should use INFISICAL_TOKEN (service token) instead</li>
<li><strong>Token path scope</strong>: Service tokens scoped to / cannot access secrets in child paths like /git_actions; each path requires its own token or use &#8211;recursive with the CLI</li>
</ul>
<h2>Integration Flow and Usage Patterns</h2>
<p>The typical workflow orchestrated by this skill follows a clear pattern:</p>
<ol>
<li>fnox.toml defines infisical as a provider with project/environment configuration</li>
<li>fnox exec &#8212; resolves secrets from the provider and injects them as environment variables</li>
<li>mise tasks can wrap fnox exec to run commands with secrets injected</li>
<li>Alternatively, mise env plugins can call fnox directly for auto-injection on cd</li>
</ol>
<h2>Real-World Applications</h2>
<p>The devtools-secrets skill is invaluable for various scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting up a new project with proper secrets management from the start</li>
<li>Migrating from hardcoded secrets to a proper secrets management system</li>
<li>Configuring CI/CD pipelines with secure secret injection</li>
<li>Debugging secrets-related issues in development or production environments</li>
<li>Ensuring team-wide secrets hygiene and security compliance</li>
</ul>
<h2>Security Benefits</h2>
<p>By using this skill, developers gain significant security benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Elimination of hardcoded secrets in code repositories</li>
<li>Centralized secrets management with proper access controls</li>
<li>Audit trails for secrets access and usage</li>
<li>Environment-specific secrets isolation</li>
<li>Prevention of accidental secret exposure through automated hooks</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The devtools-secrets OpenClaw skill represents a comprehensive approach to secrets management in modern development workflows. By providing knowledge, guardrails, and enforcement mechanisms for the mise + fnox + infisical toolchain, it helps developers implement secure, scalable, and maintainable secrets management practices. Whether you&#8217;re setting up a new project or improving existing secrets hygiene, this skill provides the guidance and protection needed to handle sensitive credentials properly throughout the development lifecycle.</p>
