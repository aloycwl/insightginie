<h1>Understanding the Telegram Smart CTA Skill in OpenClaw</h1>
<p>In the world of digital communication, user experience is paramount. The Telegram Smart CTA Skill, developed by <a href="https://github.com/openclaw/skills">OpenClaw</a>, aims to enhance user interactions on Telegram by providing context-aware dynamic Call to Action (CTA) buttons. This skill is designed to make conversations more efficient and interactive, tailoring responses to the user&#8217;s needs based on time and context.</p>
<h2>Overview of the Telegram Smart CTA Skill</h2>
<p>The Telegram Smart CTA Skill is a tool that appends relevant, time-sensitive, and task-oriented CTA buttons to replies sent to users on Telegram. This feature is particularly useful for agents who need to respond promptly and effectively to user queries.</p>
<h2>Key Features and Functionalities</h2>
<h3>Time of Day Awareness</h3>
<p>One of the standout features of this skill is its time of day awareness. The skill adapts the type of buttons displayed based on the time of the day, ensuring that the user receives the most relevant options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Morning (07:00 &#8211; 10:00):</strong> The skill focuses on providing buttons for daily briefings, commute status, and agenda checks.</li>
<li><strong>Work Hours (10:00 &#8211; 16:00):</strong> During work hours, the skill offers buttons related to task progress, deep research, and project-specific actions.</li>
<li><strong>Wrap-up (16:00 &#8211; 18:00):</strong> In the wrap-up phase, users are provided with options for daily recaps, route home status, and preparations for the next day.</li>
<li><strong>Night (20:00 &#8211; 23:00):</strong> In the evening, the focus shifts to reflection, mood checks, and planning for the next day.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Context Awareness</h3>
<p>The skill also considers the context of the conversation, providing buttons that are tailored to the user&#8217;s current task or activity. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the user is working on administrative or planning tasks, the skill offers buttons for document drafting or data lookup.</li>
<li>If the user is engaged in creative or design tasks, the skill provides buttons for tool links or asset management.</li>
<li>If a task has just been completed, users are offered &#8220;Next Steps&#8221; or &#8220;Recap&#8221; buttons.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The &#8216;Free Text&#8217; Fallback</h3>
<p>To ensure that users always feel in control, the skill includes a &#8220;Free Text&#8221; option, allowing users to input their queries manually. This fallback option is essential for providing a comprehensive user experience.</p>
<h2>Implementation Pattern</h2>
<p>The implementation of the Telegram Smart CTA Skill involves using the <code>message</code> tool with the <code>buttons</code> parameter. The buttons array is organized as an array of arrays (rows) of button objects, each containing a <code>text</code> and <code>callback_data</code> field.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example implementation for the wrap-up phase:</p>
<pre><code>message(
  {
    action: "send",
    target: "USER_ID",
    message: "I've prepared the daily report for you.",
    buttons: [
      [
        { text: "📝 Daily Recap", callback_data: "/update" },
        { text: "🏠 Route Home", callback_data: "Check route home" }
      ],
      [
        { text: "⏭️ Tomorrow's Agenda", callback_data: "What is the agenda for tomorrow?" },
        { text: "⌨️ Manual Input", callback_data: "keyboard_manual" }
      ]
    ]
  }
)</code></pre>
<h2>Best Practices and Guidelines</h2>
<p>When responding to users on Telegram, it&#8217;s important to consider whether providing quick-action buttons would enhance efficiency. The key to effective use of the Telegram Smart CTA Skill is understanding the user&#8217;s needs and providing relevant options.</p>
<h3>Button Selection Logic</h3>
<p>The button selection logic is crucial for ensuring that the options provided are relevant and useful. Here are some best practices:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relevance:</strong> Ensure that the buttons provided are directly relevant to the user&#8217;s query or task.</li>
<li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Keep the number of buttons to a minimum to avoid overwhelming the user.</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Use clear and concise text for button labels.</li>
</ul>
