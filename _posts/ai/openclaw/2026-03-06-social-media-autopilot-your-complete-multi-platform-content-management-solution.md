<h2>What is Social Media Autopilot?</h2>
<p>Social Media Autopilot is a comprehensive skill for OpenClaw that transforms your agent into a powerful multi-platform social media management system. This skill enables you to schedule, compose, and publish content across X (Twitter), LinkedIn, and Instagram from a single interface, complete with approval workflows, content calendars, and detailed performance analytics.</p>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re a solo entrepreneur managing your brand presence or a marketing team coordinating campaigns across multiple platforms, Social Media Autopilot provides the infrastructure needed to maintain a consistent and professional social media presence without the manual overhead of posting to each platform individually.</p>
<h2>Core Features and Capabilities</h2>
<h3>Multi-Platform Publishing</h3>
<p>The skill supports publishing to three major social networks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>X (Twitter):</strong> 280-character limit, auto-threading for longer content, image upload via media endpoint</li>
<li><strong>LinkedIn:</strong> 3000-character limit, supports articles and documents</li>
<li><strong>Instagram:</strong> Requires media (image/video), 2200-character caption limit</li>
</ul>
<p>Each platform has specific requirements and limitations, and the skill automatically adapts content format, character counts, and media handling for optimal presentation on each network.</p>
<h3>Content Calendar Management</h3>
<p>Social Media Autopilot includes a robust content calendar system that allows you to visualize your posting schedule across all platforms. You can view weekly or monthly schedules, identify gaps in your content strategy, and reschedule posts as needed. The calendar provides a centralized view of all scheduled content, making it easy to maintain a consistent posting cadence.</p>
<h3>Approval Workflows</h3>
<p>Quality control is built into the system through mandatory approval workflows. Before any post goes live, the agent presents the draft to you with platform-specific previews. You can approve, edit, or reject posts, ensuring that only approved content gets published. This feature is particularly valuable for teams where multiple stakeholders need to review content before publication.</p>
<h3>Performance Analytics</h3>
<p>The skill tracks comprehensive engagement metrics including impressions, engagements, clicks, replies, reposts, likes, and follower growth. You can generate reports for specific time periods, analyze individual post performance, and receive daily or weekly summaries of your social media impact.</p>
<h3>Template System</h3>
<p>Reusable templates help maintain brand consistency and speed up content creation. You can create templates for common post types like product announcements, event promotions, or thought leadership content. Each template can include variables for dynamic content and platform-specific formatting instructions.</p>
<h2>How It Works: The Technical Architecture</h2>
<h3>Directory Structure</h3>
<p>All content and configuration lives in a dedicated workspace directory:</p>
<pre><code>~/.openclaw/workspace/social-media/
├── calendar.json        # Scheduled posts
├── drafts/              # Posts awaiting approval
├── published/           # Archive of sent posts
├── templates/           # Reusable post templates
└── analytics/           # Performance data
</code></pre>
<p>The skill provides initialization scripts to create this structure and set up the necessary environment.</p>
<h3>API Integration</h3>
<p>Each platform requires specific API credentials:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>X (Twitter):</strong> Requires xurl skill or X API v2 credentials including bearer token, API key, API secret, access token, and access secret</li>
<li><strong>LinkedIn:</strong> OAuth 2.0 access token (detailed setup guide provided)</li>
<li><strong>Instagram:</strong> Meta Graph API access token and business ID</li>
</ul>
<p>These credentials are stored in your environment or .env file, keeping sensitive information secure while enabling seamless API communication.</p>
<h3>Content Workflow</h3>
<p>The publishing workflow follows a structured process:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Drafting:</strong> Create posts using the draft script, specifying platforms, content, media, and optional scheduling</li>
<li><strong>Review:</strong> Posts are saved to drafts with draft status and require approval</li>
<li><strong>Approval:</strong> Agent presents drafts for review with platform previews</li>
<li><strong>Publishing:</strong> Approved posts are published to specified platforms</li>
<li><strong>Archiving:</strong> Published posts and performance data are archived for future reference</li>
</ol>
<h3>Scheduling and Automation</h3>
<p>The skill integrates with OpenClaw&#8217;s cron system for automated workflows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scheduled posts are checked every 15 minutes and published when due</li>
<li>Daily analytics summaries are generated each morning</li>
<li>Gap alerts notify you if no posts are scheduled for the next 48 hours</li>
</ul>
<h2>Use Cases and Applications</h2>

<p>Marketing teams can use Social Media Autopilot to execute comprehensive content strategies across multiple platforms. The template system ensures consistent messaging, while the approval workflow maintains quality control. Analytics help measure content performance and inform future strategy.</p>

<h3>Thought Leadership and Personal Branding</h3>
<p>Professionals building their personal brand can use the skill to maintain a consistent posting schedule without spending hours on manual posting. The content calendar helps plan thought leadership content, while analytics show which topics resonate most with your audience.</p>
<h3>Event Promotion and Coverage</h3>
<p>Events, webinars, and conferences can be promoted effectively using scheduled posts that build anticipation and provide real-time coverage. The multi-platform approach ensures maximum reach, while templates make it easy to create consistent promotional content.</p>
<h3>Customer Engagement and Support</h3>
<p>Businesses can use the skill to maintain active customer engagement through regular updates, announcements, and community building. The analytics help track engagement levels and identify opportunities for improvement.</p>
<h2>Benefits and Advantages</h2>
