<h1>Understanding the OpenClaw Kiro Search Aggregator Skill: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
<p>In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, tools that can aggregate and analyze data from various sources have become invaluable. The OpenClaw Kiro Search Aggregator skill is one such tool, designed to enhance the way we search for and understand information. This article delves into the intricacies of this skill, exploring its functionality, supported sources, and how it can be utilized effectively.</p>
<h2>Introduction to the Kiro Search Aggregator Skill</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/openclaw/skills/tree/main/skills/skills/vmining/kiro-search-aggregator">Kiro Search Aggregator skill</a> is a multi-source search skill for Kiro on OpenClaw. It aggregates and ranks results from four prominent sources: Google, Google Scholar, YouTube, and X (formerly known as Twitter). The primary goal of this skill is to provide users with a concise brief that encapsulates the most relevant information from these diverse sources.</p>
<h2>Key Features and Functionalities</h2>
<p>The Kiro Search Aggregator skill stands out due to its ability to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aggregate Results:</strong> It combines search results from multiple sources into a single, ranked list.</li>
<li><strong>Provide Concise Summaries:</strong> The tool outputs a brief summary, making it easier for users to quickly understand the gist of the search results.</li>
<li><strong>Support Multiple Sources:</strong> It integrates with several major search platforms, including Google, Google Scholar, YouTube, and X.</li>
<li><strong>Customizable Outputs:</strong> The results can be saved in both machine-readable JSON format and a more user-friendly Markdown format.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Supported Sources</h2>
<p>The Kiro Search Aggregator skill supports the following sources:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google:</strong> Utilizes the Serper API to fetch search results.</li>
<li><strong>Google Scholar:</strong> Uses the SerpAPI with the Google Scholar engine to retrieve academic and scholarly articles.</li>
<li><strong>YouTube:</strong> Leverages the Serper videos API to fetch video search results.</li>
<li><strong>X (Twitter):</strong> Employs the X recent search API to gather tweets and other relevant content from the platform.</li>
</ul>
<h2>API Keys and Configuration</h2>
<p>To utilize the Kiro Search Aggregator skill effectively, you need to configure API keys for each supported source. These keys are optional but highly recommended for seamless integration and better results. Here&#8217;s a breakdown of the required keys:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SERPER_API_KEY:</strong> This key is essential for fetching results from Google and YouTube.</li>
<li><strong>SERPAPI_API_KEY:</strong> Required for accessing Google Scholar search results.</li>
<li><strong>X_BEARER_TOKEN:</strong> Needed to retrieve results from the X platform.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Getting Started with the Kiro Search Aggregator Skill</h2>
<p>To get started with the Kiro Search Aggregator skill, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Install Dependencies:</strong> Ensure you have Python3 installed on your system, as the skill relies on it.</li>
<li><strong>Configure API Keys:</strong> Set up the necessary API keys for the sources you plan to use. These keys should be added to your environment variables.</li>
<li><strong>Run the Script:</strong> Use the provided Python script to initiate a search. Here&#8217;s an example command:</li>
</ol>
<pre>
python3 skills/kiro-search-aggregator/scripts/search_aggregator.py \
--query "AI agents workflow" \
--sources "google,scholar,youtube,x" \
--per-source 5
</pre>
<p>This command will search for the query &#8220;AI agents workflow&#8221; across Google, Google Scholar, YouTube, and X, returning the top 5 results from each source.</p>
<h2>Output and Results</h2>
<p>The Kiro Search Aggregator skill generates two primary output files:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>latest.json:</strong> This file contains the complete machine-readable results, including detailed information about each source&#8217;s output.</li>
<li><strong>latest.md:</strong> This file provides a human-readable summary, along with the top results from each source. It is designed to be user-friendly and easy to understand.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Benefits of Using the Kiro Search Aggregator Skill</h2>
<p>The Kiro Search Aggregator skill offers several advantages for researchers, content creators, and anyone seeking comprehensive search results:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Time-Saving:</strong> By aggregating results from multiple sources, the skill saves users the time and effort of conducting separate searches on each platform.</li>
<li><strong>Comprehensive Insights:</strong> The tool provides a broader perspective by combining diverse data sources, enhancing the depth and breadth of information available.</li>
<li><strong>Customizable and Flexible:</strong> Users can choose which sources to include in their searches, tailoring the results to their specific needs.</li>
