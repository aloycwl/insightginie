</ul>
<h2>Setting Up the ZipTax Skill</h2>
<p>To use the ZipTax skill, you need to set up an account on the <a href="https://platform.zip.tax" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ZipTax platform</a> and obtain an API key. The free tier offers 100 calls per month, making it suitable for initial testing and small-scale applications.</p>
<h3>Environment Variables</h3>
<p>Set the <code>ZIPTAX_API_KEY</code> environment variable with your API key. This ensures that your API key remains secure and not exposed in your code or scripts.</p>
<h2>Quick Start Guide</h2>
<p>The ZipTax skill provides three primary methods for looking up sales tax rates: address lookup, postal code lookup, and latitude/longitude lookup. Below are examples of each method using <code>curl</code> commands.</p>
<h3>Address Lookup (Most Accurate)</h3>
<p>Address lookups provide the most accurate results, as they pinpoint the exact location and associated tax jurisdiction.</p>
<p>&#8220;`html</p>
<pre>
<code>
curl -s "https://api.zip-tax.com/request/v60?address=200+Spectrum+Center+Drive+Irvine+CA+92618" \
-H "X-API-KEY: $ZIPTAX_API_KEY"
</code>
</pre>
<p>&#8220;`</p>
<h3>Postal Code Lookup</h3>
<p>Postal code lookups return all relevant tax rates within the specified ZIP code area.</p>
<p>&#8220;`html</p>
<pre>
<code>
curl -s "https://api.zip-tax.com/request/v60?postalcode=92618" \
-H "X-API-KEY: $ZIPTAX_API_KEY"
</code>
</pre>
<p>&#8220;`</p>
<h3>Latitude/Longitude Lookup</h3>
<p>Latitude/longitude lookups are useful for applications that use geolocation data to determine sales tax rates.</p>
<p>&#8220;`html</p>
<pre>
<code>
curl -s "https://api.zip-tax.com/request/v60?lat=33.6525&lng=-117.7479" \
-H "X-API-KEY: $ZIPTAX_API_KEY"
</code>
</pre>
<p>&#8220;`</p>
<h2>Workflow of the ZipTax Skill</h2>
<p>The ZipTax skill follows a structured workflow to provide accurate and comprehensive sales tax information. Here&#8217;s a step-by-step breakdown of the process:</p>
<h3>Step 1: Determine Lookup Type</h3>
<p>Decide whether to use address lookup, postal code lookup, or latitude/longitude lookup based on your specific requirements.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Choose the API Version</h3>
<p>The ZipTax API offers different versions, with <code>v60</code> being the latest and most comprehensive. For simpler use cases, <code>v10</code> provides a combined tax rate without detailed breakdowns.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Make the GET Request</h3>
<p>Send a GET request to the ZipTax API endpoint with the appropriate parameters and authentication header.</p>
<h3>Step 4: Check Response Code</h3>
<p>Verify the response code in the metadata. A response code of 100 indicates a successful request.</p>
<h3>Step 5: Read Tax Rate and Breakdown</h3>
<p>Extract the total sales tax rate from the <code>taxSummaries[0].rate</code> field and review the detailed jurisdiction-level breakdowns in the <code>baseRates</code> array.</p>
<h3>Step 6: Check Service and Freight Taxability</h3>
<p>Determine the taxability of services and freight charges by examining the <code>service.taxable</code> and <code>shipping.taxable</code> fields.</p>
<h2>Key Points to Remember</h2>
<p>Here are some essential points to keep in mind when using the ZipTax skill:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Address Lookup Precision</strong>: Address lookups provide a single precise result, while postal code lookups return multiple rates within the same ZIP code area.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication</strong>: Ensure that you include the <code>X-API-KEY</code> header or <code>key</code> query parameter in your requests for authentication.</li>
<li><strong>Rate Format</strong>: Sales tax rates are returned as decimals, where 0.0775 equals 7.75%.</li>
<li><strong>Response Codes</strong>: A response code of 100 indicates success. Always check the <code>metadata.response.code</code> field in the API response.</li>
<li><strong>Metrics Endpoint</strong>: The <code>/account/metrics</code> endpoint does not count against your API quota, allowing you to track usage without affecting your limits.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bundled Resources</h2>
<p>The ZipTax skill includes bundled resources to enhance its functionality and ease of use:</p>
