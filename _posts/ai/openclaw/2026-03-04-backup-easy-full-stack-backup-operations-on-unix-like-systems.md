<h2>What is Backup?</h2>
<p>Backup is an open-source Ruby gem that provides easy full stack backup operations on UNIX-like systems. It&#8217;s designed to simplify the complex process of backing up databases, files, and applications by providing a unified interface for creating, managing, and restoring backups.</p>
<h3>Core Features</h3>
<p>Backup offers a comprehensive set of features that make it a powerful backup solution:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Database Support</strong>: Works with MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, and many other database systems</li>
<li><strong>File Backup</strong>: Compresses and archives files and directories</li>
<li><strong>Cloud Storage</strong>: Integrates with Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Rackspace Cloud Files, and Dropbox</li>
<li><strong>Encryption</strong>: Supports AES-256 encryption for secure backups</li>
<li><strong>Compression</strong>: Built-in compression to reduce backup size</li>
<li><strong>Scheduling</strong>: Automated backup scheduling using cron jobs</li>
<li><strong>Email Notifications</strong>: Sends backup reports and alerts via email</li>
<li><strong>Backup Splitting</strong>: Splits large backups into manageable chunks</li>
<li><strong>Archive Rotation</strong>: Manages backup retention policies</li>
</ul>
<h2>How Backup Works</h2>
<p>Backup operates through a configuration-driven approach. Here&#8217;s how it works:</p>
<h3>Installation and Setup</h3>
<p>To get started with Backup, you install the gem and create a configuration file. The configuration file defines what to back up, where to store it, and how to handle the backup process.</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">gem install backup
</code></pre>
<h3>Configuration Structure</h3>
<p>Backup uses a modular configuration system where you define:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Models</strong>: Define what to back up (databases, files, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Storages</strong>: Define where to store backups (local, cloud, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Encryptors</strong>: Define encryption methods</li>
<li><strong>Compressors</strong>: Define compression methods</li>
<li><strong>Notifiers</strong>: Define notification methods</li>
</ul>
<h3>Example Configuration</h3>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">Backup::Model.new(:my_backup, 'My Backup') do

  database MySQL do |db|
    db.name     = 'my_database'
    db.username = 'user'
    db.password = 'password'
  end

  archive :documents do |archive|
    archive.add '/home/user/documents'
  end

  store_with S3 do |s3|
    s3.access_key_id = 'access_key'
    s3.secret_access_key = 'secret_key'
    s3.bucket = 'my-backup-bucket'
  end

  compress_with Gzip

  encrypt_with OpenSSL do |encryption|
    encryption.password = 'backup_password'
  end

  notify_by Mail do |mail|
    mail.on_success = true
    mail.on_failure = true
  end

end
</code></pre>
<h3>Execution</h3>
<p>Once configured, you can run backups manually or schedule them using cron:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">backup perform -t my_backup
</code></pre>
<h2>Use Cases</h2>
<p>Backup is versatile and can be used in various scenarios:</p>
<h3>Web Application Backup</h3>
