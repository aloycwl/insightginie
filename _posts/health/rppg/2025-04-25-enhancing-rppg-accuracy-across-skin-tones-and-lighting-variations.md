Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) has emerged as a transformative technology in non-invasive health monitoring, enabling the estimation of vital signs such as heart rate through standard cameras. However, the accuracy of rPPG can be significantly influenced by variations in skin tone and lighting conditions. Understanding and addressing these factors are crucial for developing reliable and inclusive rPPG systems.

Skin tone variations can impact the subtle changes in skin color that rPPG relies on to detect blood volume changes. Research indicates that rPPG methods may exhibit biases when applied to individuals with darker skin tones, leading to less accurate heart rate estimations. For instance, a study comparing rPPG methods with contact-based devices found that while the mean error was approximately 1 beat per minute (bpm) across all skin tones, the mean absolute error (MAE) for darker skin tones was slightly higher, around 3.79 bpm . This discrepancy underscores the need for rPPG systems to be trained on diverse datasets representing various skin tones to mitigate such biases.

Lighting conditions further complicate rPPG accuracy. Variations in ambient light can affect the amount of light reflected from the skin, influencing the rPPG signal. Inconsistent or extreme lighting can introduce noise, making it challenging for algorithms to accurately detect the subtle color changes associated with blood flow. For example, a study highlighted that rPPG methods may struggle under extreme lighting conditions, leading to unreliable results . Therefore, it's essential to develop rPPG systems that can adapt to different lighting environments to maintain accuracy.

Addressing these challenges requires a multifaceted approach. One promising strategy involves enhancing rPPG algorithms to be more robust across diverse skin tones and lighting conditions. For instance, the development of the PhysFlow model, which utilizes conditional normalizing flows, has shown improved performance in heart rate estimation across various skin tones by augmenting training data to include a broader range of skin colors .

Additionally, incorporating multimodal sensing can enhance rPPG reliability. Combining rPPG with other sensor modalities, such as radar, can provide complementary data that compensates for the limitations of each individual sensor. Research has demonstrated that integrating camera-based rPPG with radar sensing can improve heart rate estimation accuracy across diverse skin tones .

Moreover, the development of comprehensive datasets that include diverse demographic representations is crucial. The Multi-Domain Mobile Video Physiology Dataset (MMPD) is an example of such an initiative, providing a rich collection of facial videos under various lighting conditions and skin tones to train and evaluate rPPG algorithms .

In conclusion, while skin tone and lighting variations present challenges to the accuracy of rPPG systems, advancements in algorithm development, multimodal sensing, and diverse data collection are paving the way for more reliable and inclusive non-contact health monitoring solutions. By continuing to address these factors, the potential of rPPG in providing equitable healthcare can be fully realized.
